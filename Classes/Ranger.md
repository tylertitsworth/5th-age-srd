## Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents, or put two talents into Animal Companion, and one talent elsewhere.

You get an additional ranger class talent at 5th level, and again at 8th level.

---

### Animal Companion

_Special:_ Unlike most class talents, this talent can take up to two ranger class talent slots. Spending one talent makes you an Animal Companion initiate. Spending two makes you an Animal Companion adept.

You have a normal-sized animal companion that fights alongside you in battle. See [Animal Companion Rules](../Character-Rules/Companions.md).

If you would rather have a smaller beast as a pet, see the [Ranger's Pet](#rangers-pet) talent.

---

### Arcane Archer

If you spend one talent, you are an Arcane Archer initiate, with two, you become an Arcane Archer adept.

As an Arcane Archer, you gain a number of powers depending on whether you are an initiate or adept, and your level.

| **Ranger Level** | **Initiate** | **Adept** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 2 | 3 |
| 2nd | 2 | 4 |
| 3rd | 2 | 4 |
| 4th | 3 | 5 |
| 5th | 3 | 5 |
| 6th | 3 | 6 |
| 7th | 4 | 6 |
| 8th | 4 | 7 |
| 9th | 4 | 7 |
| 10th | 5 | 8 |

The Arcane Archer powers are organized in spheres, with each sphere containing a 1st, 3rd, and 5th level power.

You can choose the 1st and 3rd level powers from any sphere as long as you have the required level, but to access the 5th level power, you also need both the 1st and 3rd level powers of that sphere.

To use an Arcane Archer power, declare that you are using it before making a ranged weapon attack. You then pay the cost of the power, usually one charge for a 1st or 3rd level power, or 2 charges for 5th level power. You then apply the effect of the power to your ranged attack. If you make more than one attack, such as with the Double Ranged Attack talent, your Arcane Archer power only applies to one of those attacks. If you want to use them with more than one attack, pay the cost each time.

If you are an initiate, you have a number of charges equal to your Wisdom modifier, as an adept, you have your Wisdom modifier +3.

You regain all expended charges during a full heal-up. When you take a quick rest, you regain one charge as an initiate, or two as an adept.

You can only apply one power to each ranged attack, unless you have one of the feats below that allow you to stack multiple powers of one sphere.

Your existing animal companion returns to the wilderness and is replaced—after the necessary rituals—with a full-fledged monster chosen from the options below. Note that the animal companion feats described in the ranger class description can be applied to these companions as well.

---

#### Dire Stag

**Acts:** After ranger

**Advantage:** You can ride it, which probably makes you faster than you’d otherwise be. In the absence of complex mounted combat rules, simply rule that your animal companion always has the same ranges from enemies that you do (engaged, nearby, far away, and so on). In general, you and your companion will move during your turn, and when your turn is over, it’ll make a melee attack with its horns against anything you’re engaged with.

---

##### Adventurer Feat

You gain the ability to charge forward. If you start your turn unengaged, you may engage any enemy you can move to and gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll. (We note that the 13th Age Roleplaying Game generally frowns on charge bonuses, but if there’s a worthy exception, it’s mounted combat.)

---

#### Dire Wolf

**Acts:** After ranger

**Advantage:** When the dire wolf drops an enemy to 0 hp, it can howl as a free action. Nearby enemies suffer a penalty to attacks and defenses equal to half the escalation die (rounded up) until the end of the companion’s next turn.

---

##### Adventurer Feat

You can ride the dire wolf; see dire stag advantage above

---

#### Owlbear

**Acts:** After ranger

**Advantage:** Because it’s a vicious hybrid, the owlbear can make an extra attack during its turn when the escalation die is even.

---

##### Champion Feat

When the owlbear hits an enemy, that enemy is hampered until the end of the owlbear’s next turn.

---

#### Pseudodragon

**Acts:** Before ranger

**Advantage:** It flies, but unlike the eagle, you don’t drop its melee damage to compensate.

---

##### Champion Feat

The pseudodragon has a stinging tail that it incorporates into its melee attack, so it gains ongoing poison damage equal to three times your level on a natural attack roll of 18+.

---

##### Epic Feat

The pseudodragon has a 1/encounter breath weapon that attacks PD with the companion’s normal melee attack bonus. It deals 15 fire damage to 2d3 nearby enemies.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

The crit range of your First Strike attacks expands by 1 (to +3).

---

Make a basic melee attack against a nearby; if you hit, you can automatically pop free from that target, move to engage another nearby enemy, and make a basic melee attack against the new target. Repeat the process of basic attack/pop free/move to new targets until you either miss with an attack or you have attacked all nearby enemies once.

### Ranger's Pet

You have a small animal or beast that accompanies you on your adventures. Use the rules from the Wizard's Familiar talent with the following differences:

1. The creature is your pet or friend instead of your familiar.
2. Your pet is fully natural rather than partially magical.
3. Your pet can end up with more abilities, if you choose.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

Your pet gains a third ability.

---

#### Champion Feat

Your pet gains a fourth ability.

---

#### Epic Feat

Your pet gains a fifth ability.

---

### Skirmish Archer

You’ve been trained in the art of close-quarters archery, relishing the opportunity to use your bow (or other ranged attack) when you can see the whites of their eyes. You can make attacks normally even when engaged, so you don’t draw opportunity attacks from enemies you’re engaged with.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

If you successfully disengage, you can get far away from the creature you disengage from with a single move (assuming the prevailing terrain allows it).

---

#### Champion Feat

You can split up your move action: Run about half as far as you ordinarily would, make a ranged attack, then run the other half. The 13th Age Roleplaying Game treats positioning in the abstract, so work with your GM to work out what’s possible. One common tactic is to move out from behind a corner or other obstruction, shoot an arrow, then return to the safety of cover.

---

### Speak with Animals

You gain the ability to understand and speak the language of birds, mammals, lizards, amphibians, and snakes. Your conversations are generally brief, because such creatures have limited intellects and even more limited attention spans, but they’re generally capable of answering questions about their immediate proximity and other creatures in the vicinity. Their memory extends back at least a few hours and as much as a few days.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

If the creature is amenable (or properly bribed with food or other comfort), it performs a simple task for you.

---

#### Champion Feat

Your abilities extend to insects, earthworms, spiders, and similar vermin.

---

#### Epic Feat

The creature will travel four hours and deliver a short message in a squeaky voice.

---

### Summon Beasts

For one battle per day, you can call on an animal appropriate to the environment to fight at your side. The animal that arrives is chosen by the GM, and it typically has animal companion stats one level lower than your level. It departs at the fight’s conclusion.

---

#### Feat (Special)

You can apply any of the animal companion feats in the ranger’s class description to this talent as well, and the beast that arrives will benefit from the feat you chose.

---

### Survivor

Add your Wisdom modifier to saving throws and death saves.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

Increase your recovery dice to d10.

---

#### Champion Feat

You die after five failed death saves instead of four.

---

#### Epic Feat

Once per level, you can give an in-story reason why you survive a situation that is otherwise a certain death.

---

### Tracker

You have 5 skill points in survival, without having to spend your normal skill points on it. You are an expert wilderness tracker, capable of reading clues from the environment that others can't perceive. Tracking doesn't work well, however, in heavily traveled urban environments.

In addition, you have the terrain stunt power.

**Terrain stunt:** At the start of each battle in a non-urban environment, roll a d6. Any time after the escalation die reaches that number, you'll be able to use a quick action to execute a terrain stunt. Normally you can only use terrain stunt once per battle, but circumstances, geography, or excellent planning may suggest that you can pull it off more than once.

Terrain stunts are improvisational effects that play off your preternatural understanding of the wilderness and all the diverse forms of the natural world. Things like knocking a hornets nest no one had noticed onto your enemy's head, maneuvering a foe onto a soggy patch of ground that slows them down, shooting the cap off a mushroom spore in a dungeon that erupts on your enemies, getting your enemy's sword wedged into a stalactite, finding the tree branch that lets you vault up to attack the flying demon that thought it was out of axe range, and similar types of actions.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

Your grasp of the way the world is put together increases; you now can use terrain stunt in urban environments.

---

#### Champion Feat

You can track as well in urban areas as you do in the wilderness.

---

#### Epic Feat

You can track flying creatures and creatures that normally wouldn't be trackable, and there's the possibility that even teleports give you a sense of direction.

---

### Two-Weapon Defense

Double the blades means double the opportunities for parries—and ripostes. Your second weapon is effectively as good as a shield, adding +1 to your AC against enemy melee attacks. You don’t suffer the attack penalty you normally would if you were carrying a shield, and you can still use the second weapon to attack according to the two-weapon fighting rules.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

If you fight with two one-handed melee weapons, you can make a desperate parry to convert an enemy’s melee critical hit into an ordinary hit once per battle.

---

#### Champion Feat

If you fight with two one-handed melee weapons, whenever an enemy makes a melee attack against you and rolls a natural 1, you can make an opportunity attack against that foe as a free action.

---

#### Epic Feat

Your second weapon bonus to AC applies to all attacks, not just melee attacks.

---

### Two-Weapon Hurler

You can outthrow what you can’t outstab and outstab what you can’t outthrow. When you have two weapons in hand that function as both melee and ranged weapons (such as axes or daggers), you can make one basic melee attack and one basic ranged attack as a single action. Your weapon damage die drops one notch. If your first attack is a natural even hit roll (hit or miss), you can make a second attack as a free action.

You can freely make ranged attacks even if you’re engaged without suffering opportunity attacks.

When you take this talent, talk to your GM about which weapons are appropriate. The talent remains balanced even if you stretch credulity a little and allow short swords (1d6) to be used as ranged weapons or javelins (also 1d6) in melee.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

Your second attack gains a +2 attack bonus if it is against a different target.

---

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, you can use Two-Weapon Hurler after an odd attack roll.

---

#### Epic Feat

Each turn, you can pop free of one enemy before one attack roll that is part of a Two-Weapon Hurler action. You can also use your move action in between your two attacks if you wish.

---

### Two-Weapon Mastery

You gain a +1 attack bonus when fighting with a one-handed melee weapon in each hand.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

When you fight with two one-handed melee weapons, increase the damage you deal with missed attacks by adding your level to it. Most of your basic melee attacks, therefore, will deal double your level as miss damage.

---

#### Champion Feat

If you fight with two one-handed melee weapons, whenever an enemy makes a melee attack against you and rolls a natural 1, you can make an opportunity attack against that foe as a free action.

---

#### Epic Feat

One battle per day, increase the damage you deal with missed attacks to triple your level instead of double your level (from Two-Weapon Mastery).

---

### Unseelie Curse

_Special:_ You must have the [Favored Enemy](#favored-enemy) talent before you can take this talent.

The dark fey have taught you well, instructing you on a straightforward but effective curse you can deliver with a successful attack. Once per day, if you hit a favored enemy with an attack, it suffers a penalty on subsequent attack rolls equal to the escalation die (11+ save ends).

---

#### Adventurer Feat

You can use the Unseelie Curse once per encounter.

---

#### Champion Feat

The Unseelie Curse is now a hard (16+) save.

---

#### Epic Feat

The Unseelie Curse penalty applies to defenses as well.

---

### Ways of the Land

You gain a spell slot from the druid’s Circle of the Lands, you don’t need to prepare a spell in advance. When you decide to cast a spell, choose one from the list of the terrain(s) you are currently in, at your level or lower. If the spell is an at-will or once-per-battle spell, you regain your spell slot at the end of the battle or scene. If the spell is a daily spell, you regain the spell slot at your next full heal-up.

In addition, once per day per point of Wisdom modifier, you can commune with the spirits of nature to gain advantage on a skill check related to the surrounding terrain. For example, beast spirits can help you track game, river spirits can point to a source of freshwater, and earth spirits can make climbing easier.

---

#### Champion Feat

When you take a quick rest in a natural environment, roll d12s for recovery dice.

---

#### Epic Feat

You gain a second terrain caster spell slot, at two levels below your class level.

---

### Big Game Hunter (5th Level+)

Once per battle, you can perform a stunt as a move action to climb on a large or huge enemy. This does not require a skill check. You get a firm grip on their back, where you are in position to reach their weak points, but you are hard to reach for claws and teeth. The enemy has disadvantage on attacks against you, while you have advantage on attacks against them.

If you are still on the enemy on any further turns, roll a normal save (11+). On a success, you remain in position. On a natural even failure, you cling on but lose advantage. On a natural odd failure, you fall off.

---

#### Champion Feat

On a hit with a melee or ranged weapon attack against a large or huge enemy, deal 5 extra damage. Increase the bonus to 10 at 7th level, and 15 at 9th.

---

#### Epic Feat

Against huge enemies, increase the damage bonus to 20. At 9th level, increase it to 30.

---

### Champion of the Fey Queen (5th Level+)

At the start of each battle, roll 2d4 to determine the effect of a special blessing that the fey grant you until the end of the battle.

- When you rally this battle, you become invisible until you make an attack.
- Enemy attacks have a 25% (4 on a d4) chance of missing you this battle.
- 1d4 times this battle, you can teleport to a nearby location you can see as a move action.
- When you make a ranger melee or weapon attack, gain a 1d4 bonus to the attack roll.
- When you roll a save against an effect, gain a 1d4 bonus to the roll.
- Choose a sorcerer spell gained with Fey Queen’s Enchantments. Choose A) advantage on the first attack roll with it or B) a bonus use of it this battle.
- If you hit an enemy with a natural even roll on a melee or ranged weapon attack, and their hit point total after taking damage is equal to your maximum or less, that target is confused until the end of your next turn. If they have more hit points, roll 1d4: On a 3 or 4, gain the confusion effect.

---

#### Champion Feat

When the escalation die is 5+, roll again for a second benefit (reroll if you get the same benefit twice).

---

#### Epic Feat

Gain the second benefit when the escalation die is 3+.

---

### Deadly Aim (5th Level+)

While you are not engaged, you can take a quick action to aim at a nearby enemy. If you attack this enemy with a ranged weapon attack this turn, target their PD instead of their AC.

---

#### Champion Feat

You can choose to target the enemy’s MD instead of PD.

---

#### Epic Feat

With aim, you also deal half damage on a miss.

---

### Divine Avenger (5th Level+)

_Special:_ This talent requires [Ranger Ex Cathedral](#ranger-ex-cathedral).

#### Champion Feat

When an enemy drops you below zero hit points, you gain a free use of Oath of Vengeance against that enemy.

Choose between Egoist or Altruist.
