Fighter weapon attack maneuvers deal damage based on the fighter's level. You also don't have to keep track of upgrading a 1st level maneuver into a 3rd level maneuver, because all the maneuvers function at your level. You can change which maneuvers you know and have ready whenever you gain a level.

## Class Features

Fighters have two class features: Extra Tough and Threatening.

### Extra Tough

You start with nine recoveries instead of the usual eight.

#### Adventurer Feat

Increase your total recoveries by 1.

---

### Threatening

Whenever an enemy attempts to disengage from you, it takes a penalty to its check equal to your Dexterity or Constitution modifier, whichever is higher.

The penalty doesn't apply if you are stunned, grabbed, or otherwise incapable of making an opportunity attack.

#### Adventurer Feat

Whenever an enemy fails to disengage from you, you also deal damage to that enemy equal to your Dexterity or Constitution modifier. At champion tier, damage is double the modifier. At epic tier, it's triple.

#### Champion Feat

Whenever a non-mook enemy fails to disengage from you, it's vulnerable to your attacks for the rest of the battle.

## Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

You get an additional fighter class talent at 6th level.

Fighters have flexible attacks called maneuvers; you roll your attack and then choose which maneuver you want the attack to use. You only get to use one maneuver with each attack, so it's usually best to choose maneuvers with a few different triggering rolls

---

### Battlemaster

You gain a bonus fighter maneuver.

When you spend a feat on a fighter maneuver, also gain a feat of the same tier (adventurer, champion, epic) with a different fighter maneuver for free.

---

### Bravado

Once per battle as a quick action, roll 1d20 + Charisma + your level against a nearby target’s MD. If successful, that target’s AC and PD against your attacks and powers are reduced by the escalation die value for the remainder of the combat.

_Special:_ If you target a mook with this ability, it affects every member of their mob.

#### Adventurer Feat

Using bravado is now a free action. Once a full recovery, you may use this ability twice in a battle.

#### Champion Feat

The target’s attack and damage rolls against you are also reduced by the escalation die value for the remainder of the combat.

Once staggered, the target of this power also becomes hampered. It may make a normal save (11+) at the start of each turn to negate the condition for that turn only.

---

### Cleave

Once per battle, make a fighter melee attack as a free action after one of your melee attacks drops an enemy to 0 hp.

#### Adventurer Feat

If you have your move action available, you can use it before making your Cleave attack to reach an enemy you are not already engaged with.

#### Champion Feat

You can use Cleave twice each battle, but only once a round.

#### Epic Feat

You gain a +4 attack bonus with your Cleave attacks.

---

### Combat Challenge

When you make a fighter attack against an enemy you are engaged with, you mark the target. The mark ends when you are no longer engaged with the target, or when the target makes an attack against you.

While the target is marked, it takes a -2 penalty to attacks that do not target you. When the marked enemy makes an attack that does not target you, you can make a basic melee attack against it as an interrupt action.

#### Adventurer Feat

If a marked enemy can pop free from you through an ability, it still has to succeed at a disengage check, otherwise it stays engaged.

#### Champion Feat

You can use fighter maneuvers with interrupt attacks triggered by the mark.

#### Epic Feat

Marked enemies must succeed at a disengage check even if they use a teleport or similar powers to get away from you, otherwise the teleport fails and it stays engaged.

### Deadeye Archer

Your attacks with d8 ranged weapons (heavy crossbow, longbow) now deal d10 damage per level. Your attacks with d6 ranged weapons (light crossbow, shortbow) now deal d8 damage per level. In addition, your misses with basic ranged attacks deal damage equal to your level.

If you spend a quick action to aim before making a ranged basic attack, add your Dexterity modifier to the damage if you miss.

#### Epic Feat

---

#### Champion Feat

When you use this maneuver, you also gain a bonus to your PD equal to the higher of your Dexterity or Wisdom modifier until the end of your next turn.

#### Epic Feat

As a quick action, you may spend a recovery at the end of each of your turns in this battle to dodge more vigorously, extending the duration of the above AC and PD bonuses by yet another turn. Once you skip doing this on a turn, however, you can’t regain the bonus again during this battle.

---

When you wield a shield, also gain a +1 bonus to PD.

#### Epic Feat

### Pugilist

You do not suffer the standard -2 penalty to unarmed attacks, and your damage die with unarmed melee attacks increases to d8.

If you have your hands full, you can still make unarmed attacks such as kicks and head butts. You can use magic bracers like a monk.

---

### Showstopper

When an enemy triggers an opportunity attack from you, and your opportunity attack is a natural even hit, you cause the triggering action to fail and the enemy loses that action.

Once per battle, when an enemy engaged with you makes an attack that would not trigger an opportunity attack from you normally, you can make an opportunity attack against them anyway.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can use your fighter maneuvers with opportunity attacks.

#### Champion Feat

The triggering action fails on any hit with an opportunity attack.

---

### Skilled Intercept

Once per round as a free action, roll a normal save (11+) to intercept an enemy who is moving to attack one of your nearby allies. You can pop free from one enemy to move and intercept the attack. If you are engaged with more than one enemy, the others can take opportunity attacks against you.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can pop free from up to two enemies when using Skilled Intercept.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a bonus to your Skilled Intercept save equal to the escalation die.

### Taunt

Whether by questioning their parentage, disparaging their shoddy construction, or insulting the icon they serve, you attempt to draw the ire of an enemy. Once per round, you can roll 1d20 + Charisma + your level against a nearby target’s MD as a quick action. If successful, all allies gain resistance 12+ against the target’s attacks and powers until the start of your next turn; however, the target’s crit range on its attacks against you is increased by 2 for the same duration. This effect immediately ends if you don’t remain engaged or nearby the target creature.

_Special:_ If you target a mook with this ability, it affects every member of their mob. A single target (or mob) cannot be affected by more than one character’s Taunt ability at once. A character with this Talent cannot benefit from its use by another character while their Taunt effect is active.

#### Adventurer Feat

If the target of your Taunt attacks one of your allies while affected by this Talent, it takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This damage is doubled at champion tier and tripled at epic tier.

#### Champion Feat

When you use a recovery to heal, you gain any hit points above your maximum as temporary hit points. You can take recoveries while you are at maximum hit points. These temporary hit points don’t stack with temporary hit points you already have — use the higher total.

#### Epic Feat

When you are reduced below zero hit points, you remain conscious, and you can still take actions. You still roll death saves normally, and you fall unconscious when you fail a death save.

---

### Mage Slayer (5th Level+)

Once per battle, when an enemy targets you with a spell, you can roll a save (11+) to counter the spell as an interrupt action. Success means the spell has no effect on you. At the GM’s discretion, this ability also protects against monster attacks that are similar to spells, such as the breath of a dragon.
