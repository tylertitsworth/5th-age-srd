## Class Features

All sorcerers share three general class features: Access to Wizardry, Dancing Lights, and Gather Power. _Breath weapon_, _chain_, and _random energy_ are keywords used in sorcerer spells

### Breath Weapon

Spells with the _breath weapon_ keyword have a chance to be re-used during battle. Each _breath weapon_ spell lists the chance of re-using it (usually 16+). At the start of each round after you've cast the _breath weapon_ spell, make the re-use roll. Success indicates that you may re-use that spell as a standard action, but for that round only. If you fail the re-use roll, you don't have the option to re-use the spell, but you get another chance at the beginning of the next round.

The _breath weapon_ power lasts for a single battle only.

You can have only one _breath weapon_ spell active at a time. If you cast a different _breath weapon_ spell when you have an earlier spell active, the new spell cancels the earlier spell. (See the [Chromatic Destroyer Heritage talent](#chromatic-destroyer-heritage) for the path to multiple _breath weapon_ spells.)

Failing a death save cancels any _breath weapon_ spells you have active.

#### Adventurer Feat

Failing a death save no longer cancels your _breath weapon_ spells. Keep rolling the entire battle.

---

### Chain

When you attack with a _chain_ spell and get a natural even roll, you can roll another attack against a different enemy within range. Keep on rolling attacks as long as you get even rolls and don't run out of new targets. Each enemy can be targeted only once.

---

### Metamagic

A sorcerer’s magic is an innate ability, and they can intuitively control it as if they were moving a hand or a finger. Each bloodline has metamagic tricks to improve their spells. Arcane sorcerers are great at targeting their spells, whereas draconic sorcerers have a few extra tricks with their breath weapons, and so on.

To fuel these tricks, you have a pool of sorcery points equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all expended sorcery points after a full heal-up.

To use a metamagic ability, you must declare that you spend sorcery points on a spell or roll before rolling the dice, unless the description says otherwise. The benefit only applies to this casting of the spell. You can only augment a spell with one metamagic ability at a time.

If you have gained a spell through your _Access to …_ class feature, you can apply metamagic to them in the same way you augment your sorcerer spells.

#### Adventurer Feat

Increase your maximum sorcery points by 1.

---

### Sorcerous Bloodlines

Sorcerer spells are tied to a bloodline, which is a magical relationship between a sorcerer and a creature. Choose a magical bloodline to gain the benefits of that bloodline that triggers certain effects and benefits from spells of that bloodline.

_Arcane Bloodline:_ Descendants of powerful wizards

_Celestial Bloodline:_ Divine casters with angelic blood

_Draconic Bloodline:_ The pure gift granted by dragons

_Fey Bloodline:_ Progeny of fey creatures

_Umbral Bloodline:_ Engulfed by the shadows of the Underworld

---

#### Arcane Bloodline

##### Access to Wizardry

Starting at 3rd level, you can take a wizard spell in place of a sorcerer spell. The wizard spell must be two levels lower than the sorcerer spell.

_Special:_ If you have the Arcane Heritage talent, you can choose one of your wizard spells without the -2 level penalty.

###### Adventurer Feat

Use Charisma instead of Intelligence with your chosen wizard spells.

---

##### Arcane Benefit

When you gather power, you gain a sorcery point (see the Metamagic and Sorcery Points class feature above). This can temporarily give you more sorcery points than your starting pool, but unused points above your pool are lost at the end of the battle.

---

_Arcane Preservation (2 points):_ If all attack rolls with the spell are a natural 1–5, you don’t expend the spell.

_Special:_ You can take one divine domain from the cleric list as a sorcerer talent. Interpret any reference to cleric spells as applying to both sorcerer and cleric spells. If you take the domain, you also gain access to its domain spells, and you can choose one of your cleric spells without the -2 level penalty.

##### Celestial Benefit

| --- | --- |

| Odd | Deal radiant damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (x2 at 5th level; x3 at 8th) + Level to one nearby enemy. |

| 7th | Celestial Censure, Entomb, and Sorcerous Wings |
| 9th | Calling the Blood, Celestial Apotheosis, and Twilight Travel |

##### Celestial Familiars

Celestial familiars are often animals from divine realms. They resemble animals from the prime material plane, but in a true, perfect sense. Their fur is shinier, and even if they don’t speak, they have a reserved wisdom to them that is unlike any mortal creature. Celestial familiars have two familiar abilities, which can be Celestial Ward, Healing Touch, or Radiant listed below, or the Alert, Flight, Scout, Tough, or Talkative abilities from the wizard list.

_Celestial Ward:_ Once per battle, when the Sorcerer, or an adjacent ally is attacked, give the attack a penalty equal to the escalation die.

_Healing Touch:_ Once per day, the familiar can touch an ally. The ally can use a recovery to heal.

_Radiant:_ Once per battle, when you hit an enemy engaged with you, you can add 5 ongoing radiant damage per tier to the damage roll.

---

##### Celestial Metamagic

You gain the following metamagic abilities.

_Holy Spell (1 point):_ Change the spell’s damage to radiant damage.

_Rejuvenating Spell (1 point):_ The target also gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier, twice at 5th level, and thrice at 8th, plus twice the spell level

---

##### Radiant Halo

Celestial sorcerers can cast the _radiant halo_ spell as a standard action. The spell produces an intense, almost blinding light source that is centered around the top of your head. It bathes the area within 30 feet around you in a bright light which shines far past that distance. While the light provides perfect visibility as if under daylight conditions, and can even pierce dense fog, it makes attempts at stealth pretty much impossible.

At the GM’s discretion, the halo can give creatures that are attuned to darkness (such as dark elves) a -1 penalty to attacks against you.

The spell usually lasts at least an hour. You can cast it a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.

Use Charisma instead of Intelligence with your chosen wizard spells.

If you have the Sorcerer’s Familiar talent, you can choose a pocket dragon or a pseudodragon as familiar. Both start with two abilities. One is Flight, the other is Breathe Fire for the pocket dragon and Prestidigitation for the pseudodragon.

_Breathe Fire:_ Once per battle, your familiar can make a Charisma + Level attack against a nearby opponent’s PD (using your Charisma modifier and level). On a hit, it deals 1d6 per level fire damage against the target, and half damage on a miss. You can change the damage type to match the dragon’s color.

Sorcerers with the Draconic bloodline can create small elemental effects with their breath at-will. They can light a candle with fire, melt the bolts in a lock with acid, create a shocking sensation with lightning, or cool down a drink with cold. This ability deals damage equal to the sorcerer’s level, which doesn’t quite make it powerful enough for combat use.

All Umbral sorcerers can cast the _crypt candles_ spell as a standard action. The spell produces a circle of black and red candles that provide an eerie illumination within thirty feet of you. They create enough light to move around, but it’s easy to miss details in the dim, flickering lights. If you move, the zone moves with you.

The candles and their illumination can only be seen by you, your allies and any creatures with a connection to a shadowy mastermind or a prominent lich. They make invisible creatures visible.

Your familiar has two abilities, which you can choose from Consume, Corrupting Touch, Ghost-sight or Insubstantial below, or Counter-bite, Flight, or Poisonous from the wizard list. If you choose a raven, it can also be Talkative.

_Consume:_ Once per day, when an attack would take you below zero hit points, you can consume your familiar as an interrupt. Immediately heal using a free recovery. Your familiar reforms at the next full heal-up.

_Corrupting Touch:_ Once per day, your familiar can make a Charisma + Level attack against the PD of an enemy you are engaged with. On a hit, the target is weakened until the end of your next turn.

_Ghost-sight:_ While your familiar is nearby, you can sense the presence of undead, even at far away range.

_Insubstantial:_ Your familiar can pass through solid objects, but it cannot interact with physical objects (like stealing items and such). If it takes damage, it just dissolves and reappears on your shoulder at the start of your next turn. It would take an exorcism or similar to destroy it.

## Class Talents

Sorcerers possess innate talent for magic that is impulsive and chaotic where wizardry is measured and studied. Most sorcerers have strong magical links to one of the sorcerous relationships by taking a Heritage talent.

### Animated Shadow

Your shadow can fetch items and help with chores, similar to a Mage Hand cantrip.

Once per day, as a quick action, you can separate your shadow and have it aid you until the end of the battle as an independent combatant.

Your shadow has the stats, attacks and defenses as below. It acts on your initiative after you, taking a standard action, a move action, and (if applicable) a quick action. It can’t heal. When it drops to 0 hp, it’s destroyed until the next full heal-up. The shadow counts as your ally. Summoning rules don’t apply to it. It benefits from the default bonus of your items for attacks and defenses. It benefits from the escalation die.

### Exclusive Blood

You gain a bonus bloodline spell slot, which you can use to spontaneously cast spells from your bloodline. You don’t choose the spell to cast in that slot after a full heal-up. Instead, you can use it to cast any spell from your bloodline, at the highest level you can cast. If the spell is a full recovery spell, the slot is expended until the next full heal-up (although in case of a breath spell, you still recharge it during the battle normally). If the spell has a recharge roll after battle, and you succeed on the roll, you regain the spell slot instead of the individual spell. If the spell is once per battle, you also regain the slot after the battle. In case of an at-will spell, you can cast it at-will that battle, and then regain the slot after the battle.

This increased specialization comes at a cost, however, by limiting your overall spell choice. Choose two bloodlines in addition to your own bloodline. You can only cast sorcerer spells of these three bloodlines, as well as any spells gained through your Spell Access class feature. If a spell belongs to multiple bloodlines, you can cast it if you have access to one of them.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can When casting a rituals based on a spells of your bloodline, with you have advantage on the skill check.

#### Champion Feat

- The target‘s skin becomes soft and jelly-like, and it takes a -4 penalty to AC.
- The target‘s appearance changes to you or one of your allies. Attacks against you or that ally have a 50% chance of targeting this enemy instead.
- The target is shrunk to half size. It gains a +2 bonus to AC, but all its attacks deal half damage.
- The target is temporarily turned to stone. It cannot take actions, but it is also immune to all damage except psychic damage.
- The target is transformed into an angry plant version of itself. It is stuck and vulnerable to fire and axes. All its damage is changed to poison damage.

### Calling the Blood

Close-quarters Spell

Full Recovery

**Effect:** Randomly select a relationship (preferably a sorcerous one). You gain some surprising or bizarre magical effect associated with the power of that relationship to assist you. The effect is entirely up to the GM, though the immediate impact of the spell should always be favorable for you. The long-term consequences of randomly invoking the power of a relationship that may be an enemy might not be favorable for you, and should be played for narrative interest by the GM, particularly if the impact of the spell was huge for you. Since this is a full recovery spell, sizeable impact is fine, but don't award any extra effect for empowered casting, especially since the spell can be cast effectively out of combat.

#### Epic Feat

Randomly choose twice, then choose the single result you prefer.

#### Epic Feat

When you cast this spell, gain temporary hit points equal to your maximum hit points.

You can acquire one of the new spells the same round you cast this spell. Then select and acquire any other gained spells at the start of your next turn.

You can use your Charisma as the ability score that provides the acquired spells' attack bonuses and damage bonuses (if any). Other ability score references remain unchanged.
