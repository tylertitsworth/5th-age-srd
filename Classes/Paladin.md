---

## Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

You get an additional paladin class talent at champion tier, and again at epic tier.

---

### Bastion

You gain +1 AC.

In addition, once per battle when a nearby ally is hit by an attack, you can choose to lose hit points equal to half of that damage, and have your ally take only half of the damage instead. The damage you lose can come from temporary hit points, but isn't affected by damage resistance and other tricks to avoid the damage.

#### Adventurer Feat

Increase your total number of recoveries by 1.

#### Champion Feat

Once per full recovery, you can use Bastion twice in the same battle.

#### Epic Feat

When you use Bastion now, your ally takes no damage. You still lose hit points equal to half the damage.

#### Bastion Smite

On a hit, gain temporary hit points equal to the smite’s bonus damage roll.

##### Adventurer Feat

Gain twice your level in temporary hit points on a miss.

#### Champion Feat

You can now cast the cleric class feature _heal_ spell twice per full recovery.

#### Epic Feat

##### Adventurer Feat

Gain a bonus equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier to the Smite attack roll.

---

### Conviction

Define three moral convictions for your character, such as “protect the innocent,” “speak the truth,” and “never turn down a challenge.” When you make a skill check while acting based on one of your convictions, you add a d6 conviction die to the roll.

However, whenever you act against one of your convictions, you lose the use of the conviction die until the next full heal-up. If you have committed a gross violation, say you willfully lied while under oath in the above example, the conviction die becomes a penalty to all skill checks until you atone. Work out an appropriate atonement with your GM.

#### Champion Feat

While in a battle that is aligned with your moral convictions, add the conviction die to saves.

#### Epic Feat

Your conviction die becomes a d8.

#### Smite of Conviction

If you have entered the battle based on your convictions, add your conviction die to the attack roll. In addition, the first time you miss with Smite of Conviction this battle, the smite is not expended.

### Death Knight

You learn three runes, which you can use in battle via the Activate Rune power below. When you activate a rune, you can also use its special smite power.

The direct connection to death has taken a toll on you. You are [Sorta Dead](./Necromancer.md#sorta-dead), and you have a lesser version of their Wasting Away class feature.

**Wasting Away:** While Death Knights aren’t quite as wasteful with their physical bodies as necromancers, the necrotic powers still come at a price. If your Constitution modifier is +2 or higher, you take a -1 penalty to attack rolls.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a necromancer spell as a bonus power, at two levels below your class level. You can replace Intelligence with Charisma as the key ability for the spell.

#### Epic Feat

You can choose a second necromancer spell, also at two levels lower than you class level.

**For hybrid Paladin / Necromancers with this talent, there is also this special feat:**

#### Adventurer Feat

Your Death Knight paladin talent is also considered a necromancer talent, which allows you to use its benefits with necromancer talents and spells.

---

#### Activate Rune

Close quarters power

At-will

Quick Action

**Effect:** Gain the rune benefit of either the Blood, Death, or Frost rune until the end of the battle. You can only have one rune active at a time — using a different rune ends the current one. When you Smite Evil, you can use the active rune‘s smite power.

Deal the damage to ALL other nearby enemies.

#### Raise Minion

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | You can create a [Skeletal Minion](./Necromancer.md#skeletal-minion) of your level or lower instead. |

##### Adventurer Feat

If you hit with the smite, you can use the necromancer‘s Deathknell talent on the target as a free action, even if you don‘t have that talent.

##### Champion Feat

If you kill a large or huge creature, the skeleton mook you create has twice the hit points and deals double damage.

---

##### Frost Rune

Choose one of the domains listed in the cleric's class talent list. You gain all the domain's advantages, including the ability to use the domain's invocation once per full recovery.

If the domain you choose is designed to help cleric spells and attacks, reinterpret the talent to help your paladin powers. You can use the domain's feats if you wish; reinterpret them similarly if necessary.

#### Divine Smite

Hit or miss, you can use the at-will attack spell associated with your domain as a quick action this turn. If it is a ranged spell, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks with it. This replaces the smite extra damage.

##### Adventurer Feat

If you have used the invocation of your domain this battle, gain a +1 bonus to both the smite and the spell attack.

### Paladin's Challenge

When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you can choose to challenge that enemy as a free action. Until the end of the battle, provided that both you and the enemy you've challenged are conscious and capable of making an attack, you each take a –4 attack penalty against all other creatures and a –4 penalty to disengage checks from each other.

The attack penalty temporarily deactivates for the attacker when they make an attack roll against their rival, but only until the end of the attacker's turn. For example, if a creature with more than one attack attacks you first, its subsequent attacks against your allies are without the challenge penalty. However, the attack penalty resets at the end of its turn, so it does not help with opportunity attacks against your allies later in the round.

You can only have one enemy challenged at a time.

Your Paladin's Challenge ends when…

- …you or the creature you are challenging falls unconscious or drops to 0 hp.
- …you hit a different enemy with an attack (assuming you hit with the –4 penalty).
- …the creature flees far away and you choose to end the challenge.

An enemy can only be the subject of one Paladin's Challenge at a time; a new challenge overrides the previous one.

In the unlikely case in which two paladins fight each other, any use of Paladin's Challenge locks them into a challenge that only ends when one of them drops.

#### Adventurer Feat

The attack and disengage penalty for challenged enemies (but not for you) is equal to –4 or to the escalation die, whichever is higher.

#### Champion Feat

You can have two challenges active at the same time against different enemies.

#### Epic Feat

Enemies you challenge are vulnerable to your attacks.

#### Exalted Challenge

If you use the talent to challenge the target with your Smite Evil attack, the target takes radiant damage equal to your Smite Evil bonus damage whenever it attacks one of your allies.

##### Adventurer Feat
