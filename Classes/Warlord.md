## Class Features

All warlords have class features associated with _commands_ and _tactics_.

Commands allow you to help your allies fight better. You issue them as interrupt actions during their turn. To issue a command, the ally must be conscious, but line of sight isn't required.

All commands are at-will powers, though they do cost command points, and are usually limited to once per round (as an interrupt). You start each battle with 1 command point and generally gain more via the two standard warlord features: _Fight from the Front_ and _Weigh the Odds_. Excess command points go away at the end of the battle.

Your powers also include tactics that have immediate effect during your turn. Tactics, as opposed to commands, don't use command points. You also don't have to wait around for an ally's turn to use them. However, tactics don't always recharge after a battle.

You can choose the commands and tactics you want to use. A 1st-level warlord starts with a total of 4 commands and tactics. An effective warlord should choose a good balance of commands and tactics.

#### Epic Feat

Choose three of the following class talents. You get an additional warlord talent at 5th level.

### Ambassador

Whenever you or an ally gains a positive relationship point you gain insight into their goals and motives in the form of a leverage die.

Once before your next full recovery, you can add this die to any relationship advantages skill check you make. You use it on your own check or aid a nearby ally.
