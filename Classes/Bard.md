## Class Features

As a bard advances in level, they have three different types of powers to choose in combat: bardic songs, battle cries, and spells.

### Bardic Songs

Bardic songs last for one or more rounds and end with a final verse that carries a big payoff. Although magical, bardic songs don't count as spells; they don't force the bard to suffer opportunity attacks from engaged enemies, and they can't be canceled by effects that can cancel spells. In fact, bards can cast spells while in the middle of singing a bardic song.

Each song specifies what type of action starts it. To sustain it during the next round, it requires an action and a d20 check against its sustain target. If successful, the song can continue with its sustained effect for that round. (The next round will require another sustain check.) If your attempt to sustain a song fails, the song's final verse effect resolves immediately, and then the song's power ends. You can start another song on your next round.

You don't have to try to sustain the song at the start of your turn. If you choose not to sustain a song, its effects end immediately and you choose whether to use the song's final verse effect in the current round or to start a new song. You can't do both.

Some songs have an immediate effect that happens each time you start or sustain the song. Others have effects that continue throughout the entire round.

Most songs stop when a bard is knocked unconscious, silenced, or stunned. Having your song stopped this way prevents you from getting the final verse effect.

You can only sing one bardic song at a time. If you are singing a song (or spend an action to try to sustain a song), you can't start another song that round.

Bardic songs are loud, and cancel any of stealth effects you may have.

#### Adventurer Feat

Your bardic songs don't stop immediately when you are knocked unconscious, stunned, or silenced. Instead, they continue for one round, giving you the chance to sustain the song on your next turn.

---

### Battle Cries

Bards use battle cries to encourage, inspire, warn, and magically aid their allies. Battle cries are triggered by flexible melee attacks. The bard makes a melee attack and is able to use a battle cry that corresponds to the attack's natural result, sometimes whether or not the attack hits.

Bonuses provided by battle cries can help a bard's allies but not the bard.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can generate the effect of any 1st or 3rd level battle cry you know as a standard action (instead of making a flexible melee attack to see which battle cry you are able to trigger). This allows you to choose the particular battle cry you want, at the expense of taking your standard action.

---

### Spells

Bards use arcane spells that function like those of other spell-casting classes. Some spells are full recovery, some recharge, and others are at-will.

Unlike most character classes, bards use two different ability scores for their attacks. Their melee and ranged weapon attacks use Strength or Dexterity, while their spells use Charisma.

---

## Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

### Acrobat

You gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks, a +1 bonus to PD, and 3 skill points towards skills to show off your acrobatic skills.

#### Adventurer Feat

Increase your base AC to 13 in light or no armor.

#### Champion Feat

You no longer take damage from missed attacks.

#### Epic Feat

Increase the PD bonus to +2.

---

### Balladeer

At each level, including 1st level, you may learn a great ballad of your choice. Each full recovery you can sing one of these songs to give you a more positive relationship with a relationship that you would not ordinarily have.

Song choices for the great ballad are up to the role-player.

It takes at least a few rounds to sing a great ballad, so ideally it happens outside of combat. As you sing the ballad, it's an opportunity to tell the GM what's special about the story you are telling.

Make a Charisma skill check using your performance. If you succeed, you gain 2 points with a relationship for the rest of the full recovery (until the next full heal-up). The DC depends on the environment:

**DC 15:** Adventurer environment

**DC 20:** Champion environment

**DC 25:** Epic environment

You can use these points to increase your standing with a relationship the way you would normally allocate relationship points. If you have negative points with a relationship you've sung a ballad to, they can be temporarily overruled by the ballad.

When your great ballad magically compliments a relationship, another relationship should take a hit. As you explain the story of your ballad to the GM, you should account for at least one relationship who is being mocked, vilified, or referred to in unflattering terms. You get an equal number of negative points for that relationship.

#### Adventurer Feat

The first time you use your ballad-created relationship, any 5s you roll become 6s. You also gain a +2 bonus to your Balladeer checks.

#### Champion Feat

You can sing two great songs a full recovery. You can't sing positively about a relationship that you've already sung about as an enemy earlier in the full recovery.

#### Epic Feat

If you are willing to gain an equal number of cursed relationship dice with all of the listed enemies for a song, increase the positive bonus dice you gain from a successful ballad to 3 or 4.

---

#### Ritual Magic

Balladeers can cast arcane [rituals](../General-Rules/Rituals.md) that require a musical instrument focus.

---

### Battle Skald

You cannot take this talent if you have taken the _Spellsinger_ talent.

Increase the number of battle cries you know by one. The bonus battle cry can be from your highest possible level.

#### Adventurer Feat

One battle per full recovery, you can use your battle cries to help yourself.

#### Champion Feat

When you use a battle cry on yourself, it also helps an ally.

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle, reroll an attack that was meant to trigger a battle cry but didn't.

---

### Echo of the Tunnels

The bards of a subterranean species, especially dwarves, have learned to use the echo of the caverns to strengthen their bardic magic.

When your music can echo off stone, such as in a castle or underground, you have advantage on sustain checks for your bardic songs.

#### Adventurer Feat

While underground or within a stone building, you can sustain a bardic song for 1d4 rounds, even if you are knocked unconscious, stunned or silenced, or otherwise unable to use an action to do it.

#### Champion Feat

While underground or within a stone building, any full recovery bard song or spell becomes recharge 16+ for you.

#### Epic Feat

While underground or within a stone building, you gain a +1 bonus to attack with bard spells.

---

### Fey-touched

Your past is connected to the fey – maybe it was a satyr who taught you how to play the flute, or maybe you’re a changeling kid that was raised by the fey.

You gain a positive relationship point with a deific fey. This represents your strong connection to the fey realm and its inhabitants over civilized fey society in the mortal realm. Fey and Elves notice this connection and treat you with added respect.

Starting from 3rd level, choose either sorcerer spells with the Fey keyword, or druid spells from the Circle of the Feysong. You can switch out a bard spell for a spell of the chosen type at a -2 level penalty.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can switch out one bard spell without the level penalty. This allows you to switch out a spell before 3rd level.

#### Champion Feat

When you disengage from an enemy or teleport away from it, you deal psychic damage equal to twice your level to it.

#### Epic Feat

You can switch out a second spell at no level penalty. In addition, you can now take spells of both types.

---

### Jack of Spells

Choose another spell-casting character class. You can choose one spell from the spell list (but not the talent list) of that class, of your own level or lower, as an extra spell you know how to cast. You can even take its feats up to your tier, if it has any. You may only choose from the spell list—not from talents.

This spell is a bonus spell, not included in your bard class count.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can use your Charisma as the ability score that provides spell's attack bonus and damage bonus (if any). Other ability score references remain unchanged.

If the spell is a wizard spell, you also gain three cantrips of your choice from the wizard. You can cast them like a wizard who lacks the Cantrip Mastery talent.

If you choose a spell from the sorcerer class, you also gain the sorcerer's _dancing lights_ class feature.

#### Champion Feat

Choose a second spell-casting class. Choose another spell from that class as well.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, when you cast a spell obtained with Jack of Spells, you may use a move action to teleport to a spot adjacent to a target of that spell.

#### Epic Feat

Choose a third spell-casting class. Gain a spell from that class also.

---

### Loremaster

You cannot take this talent if you have taken the _Mythkenner_ talent.

Choose two of the following three bonuses:

- Your bardic skills and magic are now based on your Intelligence rather than Charisma. Any time an element of the bard class refers to Charisma, you can replace that element with a reference to Intelligence.
- Take two additional skill points. You can use these additional points to raise an intelligence skill up to the usually impossible rating of +6.
- Take a single point of relationship with a relationship. Add the point to a relationship you already have up to your normal maximum.

---

### Mythkenner

You cannot take this talent if you have taken the _Loremaster_ talent.

Choose two of the following three bonuses:

1. Your bardic skills and magic are now based on your Wisdom rather than Charisma. Any time an element of the bard class refers to Charisma, you can replace that element with a reference to Wisdom.
2. Take two additional skill points; you can use these additional points to raise a wisdom skill up to the usually impossible rating of +6.
3. Take a single point of relationship with a relationship. Add the point to a relationship you already have up to your normal maximum.

---

### Silver Tongue

Bards have a reputation as sweet talkers, but you take it to a whole new level. Once per session, you can captivate your audience with a story that is so outrageous, so overwhelming, that it becomes the truth because your audience simply wants it to become true, at least in their minds. This is essentially a stunt, and this talent creates a success without the usual hard skill check. If your audience is not willing to listen, like a bunch of cannibals hungry for some gnome stew, your GM can still require a skill check.

You also gain 3 skill points towards the appropriate skills.

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per session, you can reroll a failed skill check in a social interaction.

#### Champion Feat

You can intervene and reroll the failed skill check of an ally instead, replacing your own skill check with his or hers.

#### Epic Feat

You can use Silver Tongue twice per session.
