## Class Features

All monks have attacks dealing JAB, PUNCH, and KICK damage, use forms as the basis of their actions during each round, use ki points, and are considered to fight with two-weapons even when they're just fighting with their fists and feet. They also can take advantage of magical bracers.

---

### JAB, PUNCH, and KICK Attacks

Under normal circumstances, melee weapons that are traditional in a monk's style function like special effects for monks. Most monk attacks are rated as JAB, PUNCH, or KICK attacks, in the same sense that most fighter attacks are WEAPON attacks.

- JAB attacks deal 1d6 damage per level.
- PUNCH attacks deal 1d8 damage per level.
- KICK attacks deal 1d10 damage per level.

Monks don't use weapon damage dice unless they are using a non-traditional weapon or a basic ranged attack that is not part of one of their monk forms.

When fighting barehanded, with bracers, or with traditional monk weapons, monks use damage dice based on the form they are attacking with, or PUNCH damage for basic melee attacks. While using a magic weapon, monks add the weapon's attack and damage bonus to their attacks, and they can use that weapon's power(s).

All monk attacks that use Dexterity as the attack stat use Strength as the ability score that determines damage.

---

### Forms

When you learn a monk form, you learn all three elements of that form: an **opening attack** , **flow attack** , and **finishing attack**. Each element generally requires a standard action to use.

Your first standard action attack in a battle must be an opening. Your second attack can be a flow attack from any form you know, or it can be another opening. After you use a flow attack, your next monk attack must be a finishing attack from any form you know, or it can be another opening. (You can't use flow attack twice in a row.) After a finishing attack you must start over with an opening on your next standard action. If you do not attack one turn, you must start over with an opening on your next standard action. This form progression applies whether you hit or miss with your attack.

As long as you use the proper element of the form (opening, flow, or finishing attack), you can use an opening, flow, or finishing attack from ANY of the forms you know.

When you use an element of a form, you gain an AC bonus until the start of your next turn. After using an opening attack you gain a +1 bonus to AC. After using a flow attack, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. After using a finishing attack, you gain a +3 bonus to AC. If _elven grace_ or some other power lets you use multiple elements of your forms in a turn, the AC bonuses don't stack but you do get to use the highest bonus.

---

### Ki

You gain a number of _ki_ points each day equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier. You can spend ki to modify the natural result of one of your attack rolls. Ki is a daily resource. When you take a full heal-up, you regain all your ki points. You don't regain ki during a quick rest.

After rolling an attack, you can spend 1 point of ki as a free action to change your attack's _natural_ result by 1, unless that result is a natural 1. The change can be +1 or -1. Spending ki is a free action, but you can only spend 1 point of ki each turn.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain 1 additional point of ki each day.

---

#### Champion Feat

You can spend as much ki as you like during a turn. You must spend each point of ki on a different attack roll or a different ki power.

---

#### Epic Feat

Work with your GM to invent a new ki power related to your one unique thing or some other aspect of your character's story. If the ki power is too good and overshadows your other ki powers, the GM should rule that you can only use it once a day.

---

### Two-Weapon Fighting

Since monks are trained to strike with all their limbs, they can always be considered to be fighting with two weapons in melee, even when they're barehanded. The principal advantage of "two-weapon fighting" is that you get to reroll your attack when you roll a natural 2 with a melee attack, sticking with the reroll.

---

### Bracers as Magic Items

Monks get magic-weapon style powers from magical bracers. In practice, a monk fighting barehanded looks to bracers for magical advantage. A monk who fights with the monastery's traditional weapons might use bracers or a magical weapon, but a monk wearing magical bracers can't use a magical melee weapon at the same time.

---

### Cycle Bonus

This is a monk-specific keyword. You gain a cycle bonus for the duration of your current attack progression, that is, for your opening, flow and finishing attack, until the start of your next turn after using a finishing attack. It also ends if anything breaks the current attack progression, such as the end of the battle, when you don’t attack for a round, or when you start a new progression by using an opening attack.

---

## Adventure Tier Talents

Choose three of the following adventurer-tier class talents. You get an additional monk class talent at 6th level and 9th level.

You are free to take as many of the Seven Deadly Secrets talents as you wish (up to the class limit) but you can only use one of them per battle. You can choose which one just before using it.

---

### Crane Style

You use Wisdom for attack and damage with unarmed attacks. However, your base hit points are reduced by Level + CON mod.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

Whenever you spend a ki point, also gain temporary hit points equal to your level.

---

#### Champion Feat

Whenever you spend a ki point, you also gain a +1 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.

---

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle, as an interrupt action, you can spend a ki point to make a melee basic attack against an enemy who misses you with a melee attack.

---

#### Ki Power

_Spread the Wings:_ You can spend a ki point to add your Wisdom modifier to a disengage check, after you roll.

---

### Crystal Mind

When an attack that targets MD hits you, you can roll a normal save. If you succeed, you take only half damage from the attack.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

Add your Wisdom modifier to Crystal Mind saves.

---

#### Champion Feat

On a successful save, you also block any non-damage effect from the attack.

---

#### Epic Feat

If you roll a natural 18+ on the save, you instead take no damage from the attack and can choose one nearby enemy. It takes one-quarter of the damage as you deflect the attack, and suffers any effects from it.

---

#### Ki Power

_Cleansing of Thought:_ You can spend a ki point as a free action to gain resist psychic damage 16+ until the end of the battle.

---

### Diamond Focus

You gain a +2 bonus to saves while you're not staggered.

In addition, you can go one round without using a monk attack form and still maintain your place in the attack form progression. For example, if you made an opening attack last round but don't attack this round (or with your next standard action) for any reason, even being stunned or unconscious, you can still use a flow attack with your next standard action.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

You can also use the ki power to save when you're confused or hampered.

---

#### Champion Feat

The ki power save is now an easy save (6+).

---

#### Epic Feat

You can also use the ki power to save against a last gasp effect (but it doesn't count against your total if you fail).

---

#### Ki Power

_Diamond Soul:_ When you are dazed, weakened, or stunned, you can spend 1 point of ki to make an immediate normal save (11+). If you succeed, the effect ends. If you fail, the condition affects you normally. (This power also works on effects that aren't save ends. It also breaks the stunned rule by letting you use a free action to spend ki.)

---

### Fire Fist (Seven Deadly Secrets)

#### Ki Power

_A Thousand Palms:_ You must be engaged with 2 or more enemies to use this power. After making a Flurry attack, you can spend 1 point of ki to make another Flurry attack against a target you have not already attacked with Flurry this turn.

Deal extra cold damage equal to twice your level.

---

---

#### Champion Feat

When you successfully disengage from an enemy, that enemy takes damage equal to your level. Popping free doesn't count; the damage only applies when you use the disengage action.

Once per battle, reroll an attack that qualified for Greeting Fist damage.

---

#### Ki Power

Unlike other monks, you have no attack penalty with ranged weapons, including thrown weapons, longbows, shortbows, and crossbows. Your basic ranged attacks also deal miss damage equal to your level.

Once per battle when you would make a melee attack as an element of one of your monk forms, you can use a ranged attack against a nearby enemy instead. This attack deals damage according to the JAB/PUNCH/KICK hierarchy that's part of the form rather than WEAPON damage like basic attacks.

_Seal of Steel:_ You can spend a ki point to turn a failed save against ongoing damage, or the weakened, hampered, vulnerable or stuck conditions, into a success.

---

#### Kensai

Any melee weapon is a monk weapon for you. You wield them without penalty, and you can use your monk forms with them. When wielding a melee weapon, use that weapon’s usual WEAPON damage die instead of your JAB, PUNCH or KICK.

When you wield a two-handed weapon, use Strength instead of Dexterity for the attack roll. You don’t reroll natural 2 on the attack, as you are not two-weapon-fighting.

---

#### Ki Power

You gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks.

When an enemy makes an attack against you that targets more than one creature, you only take half damage from that attack, hit or miss.

---

##### Epic Feat

Roll a normal save at the end of any turn in which you use the _Wind's Comerade_ ki power. If you succeed, your _flight_ lasts until the end of your next turn. (It's not advisable to count on this working by staying in midair, though you could of course fly next to a wall, counting on your ability to slow your fall as outlined above!)

---

### Ninjutsu

You learn a rogue power of your level or lower. If it is an attack power, you can use your JAB as the weapon, and it counts as an opening attack. If you choose a momentum power, don’t track momentum — instead, spend one ki point to use the power.

---

### Phoenix-touched

If you wish, any time an element of the monk class refers to Wisdom, you can replace that element with a reference to Charisma.

In addition, while you're staggered, when you roll a natural even attack roll, you heal damage equal to your Strength modifier or your Wisdom modifier, double that modifier at 5th level, and triple it at 8th level.

---

#### Champion Feat

Once per day after rolling a death save, you can gain +4 bonus to the roll.

---

#### Epic Feat

The first time you die after taking this feat, you are resurrected at a place of power like your home monastery or other sanctum between one and four days later, assuming another resurrection doesn't find you first. (This counts against your normal resurrection limit, as normal.)

---

---

##### Adventurer Feat

The AC bonus from the _Supreme Warrior Discipline_ ki power also applies to your PD. An attack against your PD that misses also ends the bonus.

---

---

### Acolyte of Death

Choose a necromancer spell of your level or lower as a bonus power. You can choose any spell except summoning spells and spells granted by talents. You can switch the spell after each full heal-up. If the spell is an at-will attack spell, you can cast it in place of a flow attack. If the spell is a limited use attack spell, you can cast it in place of a finishing attack, at the frequency you can normally cast it (such as daily). Use your Wisdom as the ability score that determines attack and damage with the spell.
