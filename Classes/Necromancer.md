## Class Features

All necromancers share the following class features.

### Arcane Implements

As a character casting arcane magic, your best options for improving your spellcasting are wands and staffs.

### Death's Master

All necromancers must spend at least one relationship point with any necromantic relationship. (This may be conflicted or negative.) If your one unique thing somehow suggests that you might be free of this requirement, make a case to your GM that this is a way in which you are unique.

### Ritual Magic

Necromancers can cast arcane [rituals](../General-Rules/Rituals.md).

### Spell Choices

Like other standard spellcasters, you choose the spells you will be able to cast after each full heal-up.

### Summoning

Your summoning spells use the standard summoning rules. The following feats enable you to improve your summoning powers.

#### Adventurer Feat

Your summoned creatures can add the escalation die to their attacks.

#### Champion Feat

When you summon mooks, increase the number of mooks you summon by 1.

#### Epic Feat

The first time one of your non-mook summoned creatures is dropped each battle, roll a normal save. If you succeed, the summoned creature is not slain but instead remains in the battle with 10 hp.

### Wasting Away

Necromancers are frail, gaunt, parched, skinny, sickly, wasted, cadaverous, dependent on unearthly substances, or partially dead. This isn't just an aesthetic note—as a necromancer, you must subtract your Constitution modifier from all your necromancer spell attacks if your modifier is positive. In addition, you don't die until you fail five death saves. Similarly, you don't succumb to last gasp save effects until you fail the fifth save.

#### Adventurer Feat

If your Constitution modifier is negative, add +1 to your necromancer spell attacks.

#### Champion Feat

You don't die from damage until your negative hit points equal your maximum hit points, instead of half your maximum.

#### Epic Feat

One battle per day, you can choose to succeed with death saves on an 11+ instead of a 16+.

## Class Talents

### Black Cabalist

You have advantage (roll twice and take the better result) on skill checks regarding occult lore, death, and necromancy. This includes skill checks you make to cast necromantic rituals.

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per day, when you cast a necromancer spell, narrate how you studied the spell in a flashback. You have advantage on the first attack roll with the spell.

#### Champion Feat

If you invest a feat into a necromancer spell, you also gain the benefits of any other feat of that spell, up to your current tier.

#### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can cast a necromantic ritual by sacrificing a living creature instead of expending a spell.

### Bloodseeker

You have advantage on skill checks to sense the heartbeat of nearby living creatures.

Once per battle, you can drink a cup of blood as a standard action to fuel your magic, similar to a sorcerer gathering power. Heal hit points equal to your Charisma modifier, twice at 5th level and thrice at 8th, + level. The next spell you cast this battle deals double damage. If that spell is a summoning spell, the creature you summon has advantage on its first attack, and that attack deals double damage.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you cast an empowered necromancer spell, the target is vulnerable to it (+2 to your critical threat range).

#### Champion Feat

When you gather power, you can also save against a “save ends” effect.

#### Epic Feat

You now heal your Charisma modifier x3 + twice your level.

### Cackling Soliloquist

If you spend your move action, your quick action, _and_ your standard action casting a daily spell that ordinarily only requires a standard action—while screaming grandiloquently, cackling maniacally, or megalomaniacally describing the grandeur of your plans and the futility of your enemies' resistance—the daily spell is recharge 18+ after battle instead of daily, and you can invent a slight improvement to the spell, especially if it's partly story-oriented, that provides an extra benefit determined by the GM or by you (with GM approval).

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your level + Charisma modifier when you use Cackling Soliloquist, double your Charisma modifier at 5th level, and triple it at 8th level.

#### Champion Feat

Your soliloquized spell is now a recharge 16+ after battle instead of 18+.

#### Epic Feat

Once per day, you can hog the spotlight when using Cackling Soliloquist. When you do, you heal using a free recovery and steal the escalation die, keeping it all to yourself. Until the end of your next turn, you are the only creature—PC, NPC, or monster—that can use the escalation die, _and_ you treat the escalation die as if it were an 8. At the end of your next turn, return the escalation die to the table, one point higher than it was when you seized it.

### Dead Wizard

You gain the Cantrips class feature from the wizard class. The talent functions like the wizard's class feature with the following exceptions:

- You can't cast _mending_.
- Your _light_ cantrip has a sickly flicker or a dark edge. Feel free to call it _darklight_.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can take a wizard spell in place of one of your necromancer spells of the same level. You can change this spell for a new one you know whenever you take a full heal-up.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a bonus wizard spell that is at least two levels below your level, in addition to the spells you can cast as a necromancer. You can change this spell for a new one you know whenever you take a full heal-up.

#### Epic Feat

You gain a second bonus wizard spell, but this one can be of your level or lower. You can change this spell for a new one you know whenever you take a full heal-up.

### Death Priest

When you have relationship advantages you're waiting to use during a session, you can interpret them as interactions/public discussions with the spirits of the recent or ancient dead in the area, providing information you require (and possibly, when there's a complication, also providing that information to your enemies or otherwise getting you into some type of trouble).

_**Séance:**_ Similarly, once per day while you're not in battle, you can perform a short rite (1–2 minutes) to call upon a spirit of the dead that's related to a random relationship other than a necromantic relationship. The spirit will speak to you, relaying information helpfully, or under protest if it's related to a relationship that considers you an enemy or with which you have a negative relationship.

You can't always rely on the dead to speak the truth, or to know what they are talking about. Whenever you use the séance power above, the GM secretly rolls a d20 before the discussion. On a 3+, the spirit knows what it is talking about. On a 1–2, the information is outdated, sabotaged, or just erroneous.
>Note that this roll is only used for séances, not for spirits you talk to thanks to relationship advantages mentioned above.

At 5th level you can use séance two times per day. At 8th level you can use it three times per day.

#### Adventurer Feat

Whenever you take a full heal-up, you can choose whether you'd like to move a single point in a relationship with a positively or negatively aligned relationship to one of the other relationships. Tell a story of what has taken place to cause the shift, unless it's already obvious from the events of the campaign. When you shift this relationship, the new point must match any current relationships, but it can be positive or negative if it's currently the only point you have with that relationship.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a bonus cleric spell that is at least two levels below your level, in addition to the spells you can cast as a necromancer. You can change this spell for a new one you know whenever you take a full heal-up. You can also substitute references to Wisdom with references to Intelligence in the spell.

#### Epic Feat

You gain the lowest-tier feat, if any, associated with your bonus cleric spell.

### Deathknell

As a quick action, you can drop a nearby enemy that has 5 hp or fewer down to 0 hp. When you drop an enemy using Deathknell, you heal 1d6 hit points.

You can use Deathknell to drop a mook, but only if it's the last mook in its mob and the mob has 5 hp or fewer left.

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Drop an enemy with 10 hp or fewer. Heal 1d10 hit points. |
| 5th | Drop an enemy with 15 hp or fewer. Heal 2d8 hit points. |
| 7th | Drop an enemy with 20 hp or fewer. Heal 4d6 hit points. |
| 9th | Drop an enemy with 25 hp or fewer. Heal 4d8 hit points. |

#### Adventurer Feat

When you use Deathknell, one of your nearby conscious allies can gain the healing instead of you.

#### Champion Feat

Double the healing gained from Deathknell when you drop an enemy.

#### Epic Feat

You can increase the escalation die by 1 instead of healing when you kill a non-mook enemy with Deathknell.

### Eternal Tormentor

_Special:_ You cannot choose both this talent and the Redeemer talent.

Undead you summon deal extra damage equal to your level on a hit.

However, if an undead you summoned rolls a natural 1 on an attack, your control slips and it is free to act as it pleases (under GM control). Brainless undead like skeletons and zombies just shuffle off or attack the nearest living creature until destroyed, whereas intelligent undead like wraiths will try to get back at their tormentor. You cannot dismiss undead who have slipped from your control. As a standard action, you can attempt to regain control of your summoned undead with an Intelligence + Level vs. MD attack.

#### Adventurer Feat

On a critical hit, your summoned undead deal 1d6 extra damage (2d6 at 5th level; 3d6 at 8th).

#### Champion Feat

When you spend a quick action to allow a summoned undead to benefit from the escalation die (as per the summoning rules on page XX), it gains a +2 bonus to its critical threat range that round.

#### Epic Feat

Your non-mook summoned undead deal 3d6 extra damage on normal hits too.

### Grave Bond

Whenever you spend a recovery to heal, one nearby undead you summoned, or your skeletal minion, heals half of the amount.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can choose to grant the full amount to the undead and heal half the amount yourself.

#### Champion Feat

When you heal your summoned undead with this talent, the target also gains a +2 bonus to attacks and defenses until the end of your next turn.

#### Epic Feat

All other undead under your control, except the primary target, heal a quarter of the amount.

### It's Complicated

You gain one negative relationship point.

You gain an extra necromancer spell at the highest spell level you can normally cast (as shown under spells known on the necromancer level progression chart). For example, you would gain an extra 3rd level spell if you're 4th level, or an extra 5th level spell if you're 5th level.

#### Champion Feat

All 6s you roll with relationship dice count as 5s. You gain another extra necromancer spell, but it must be at least two levels lower than your level.

### Redeemer

Undead you summon release holy energy bursts as they drop to 0 hp, dealing a small amount of damage to each enemy engaged with them.

Mooks you summon deal holy damage equal to your Charisma modifier (double your Charisma modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

Non-mooks you summon deal holy damage equal to your Charisma modifier x 1d4 (1d8 at 5th level; 2d6 at 8th level).

In story terms, you're not likely to have a positive relationship with any necromantic deities if you take the Redeemer talent.

#### Adventurer Feat

The first time each battle an undead creature you have summoned attacks, it gains an attack bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.

#### Champion Feat

When one of your summoned undead creatures drops to 0 hp, instead of having it deal holy damage to engaged enemies, you can heal hit points equal to that damage instead.

#### Epic Feat

You can memorize a single spell that summons undead twice.

### Skeletal Minion

You have a skeleton minion the same level as you that acts as a servant, fights alongside you in battle, and is replaced by a new skeletal minion when it inevitably collapses or is destroyed. It is not a summoned create; summoning rules don't apply.

Your minion acts on your initiative, taking a standard action, a move action, and (if applicable) a quick action. You decide whether it takes its turn before or after you.

The listed attack and damage values are for melee attacks. Your skeletal minion can't heal. When it drops to 0 hp, it's destroyed for that battle. When you take a quick rest, a new (or patched up) skeletal minion will take its place.

#### Level 1

| Normal 1st level | **Attack +6 vs. AC--1d6 damage** | **AC** **PD**| **17** **15** |

#### Skeletal Minion Feats

Like animal companion feats, skeletal minion feats don't build on each other. You don't have to take them in a particular order, as long as you qualify for the tier.

##### Adventurer Feats

- Your skeletal minion now adds the escalation die to its attack rolls.
- When an enemy attempts to disengage from the skeletal minion, it takes a penalty to the check equal to the escalation die.
- As a quick action, you can set your skeletal minion ablaze, or extinguish the blaze. While it's flaming, your skeleton minion's damage dice increase by one size, and it deals fire damage with its melee attacks, but it takes damage equal to your level each time its natural attack roll is odd.

##### Champion Feats

- Add a damage die of the same size to your skeletal minion's damage rolls (for example, 3d6 becomes 4d6).
- Add double your Charisma modifier to your skeletal minion's hit points. At 8th level, add triple it.
- Add a damage die of the same size to your skeletal minion's damage rolls (for example, 4d6 becomes 5d6, and this is cumulative with the champion feat).

##### Epic Feats

- Your skeletal minion gains a +2 bonus to all defenses.

### Solemn Beauty

The first time an enemy rolls a save against an effect from your necromancer spells, increase the save DC by your Charisma modifier. This includes saves against ongoing damage. Note that a natural roll of 18+ always saves.

#### Adventurer Feat

When an enemy fails a save against one of your spells, heal hit points equal to the spell level.

#### Champion Feat

Once per scene, you gain advantage on a Charisma-based skill check, as you enthrall the target with your otherworldly presence.

#### Epic Feat

Against mooks and normal-strength enemies, you always increase the save DC, not just the first.

### Sorta Dead

In some ways, you're dead already. You don't need to eat or sleep or breathe. You can't drown in normal water/liquid, though magical gas will still affect you.

When a spell or effect targets or applies to undead, you can decide whether you want to count as undead for that specific effect. (For example, you could count as undead to take advantage of a target's vulnerability created by the _ripping claws_ attack of a starving ghoul mook you summoned via _summon undead_.)

The first time you die each level, roll a normal save, adding your Charisma modifier. If you succeed, you heal using a free recovery instead of dying. If you were dying because of last gasp saves, consider yourself saved from the last gasp problem also.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain _resist poison 16+_ and _resist negative energy 16+_.

#### Champion Feat

The spells _zombie form_, _ghoul form_, _ghost form_, and _vampiric form_ all function as recharge 16+ after battle spells for you, though you still memorize them as daily spells.

#### Epic Feat

No undead creature that is not under the direct command of a necromantic relationship can attack you unless you attack it or cast a spell against it first.

### Tomb Knight

You can wield one-handed martial melee weapons and wear shields and heavy armor without an attack penalty. Increase your base AC in heavy armor to 13.

You gain a 3-point skill put toward knightly virtues, such as heraldry, falconry, jousting, or courtly love.

_Special:_ If you are a hybrid necromancer, you now count as a “skillful warrior” and no longer reduce your WEAPON die from the necromancer side. However, you lose one necromancer spell slot of the highest level you can cast.

#### Adventurer Feat

When wielding a shield, you can cast ranged necromancer spells without provoking opportunity attacks.

#### Champion Feat

If you hit with your next melee attack after you cast a necromancer spell, you deal additional negative energy damage equal to the spell level. Only count the highest level spell, multiple spells do not stack.

#### Epic Feat

You gain a +1 bonus to hit with necromancer spells against enemies you are engaged with.

### Vigor Mortis

Increase your base PD to 11 and your base hit points to 7 + Con.

Once per day per Dexterity modifier (minimum 1), you can perform a bizarre freak show stunt with your body. Bend it in unnatural ways, pierce it, cough up bugs, maybe even detach and reattach a limb. If you stare into the disgusted faces of your fellow players, you are doing it right. This does not require a skill check, unless the GM decides to require one, such as for a particularly artistic execution.

#### Adventurer Feat

While staggered, increase your recovery dice to d8s.

#### Champion Feat

You can expend one use of your stunt as an interrupt action to reduce the damage you take from a physical attack to half.

#### Epic Feat

Gain three extra daily uses of your stunt.

## 1st Level Spells

### Bat Form

Close-quarters spell

Daily

**Effect:** You transform into a small, winged, bat-like creature with glowing red eyes. In bat form, you can fly, locate objects via echolocation, hunt insects, and sleep upside down, but you can’t really fight. Your small size and erratic movement makes you harder to hit (+2 AC), but if you take any damage, you revert back to your normal form. Otherwise, you can stay in bat form for up to a full day, or change back as a standard action any time. You cannot cast spells in bat form.

#### Champion Feat

You can transform one ally per spell level into a bat.

**Effect:** You can ask the corpse a number of yes/no questions that the leftover fragments of personality/spirit within the corpse will attempt to answer truthfully using the information it had when it died. The magic uses the caster's knowledge of language so no translation is needed. The first question is free. The second question requires a DC 15 necromancy skill check using Intelligence if the corpse is "friendly," and Charisma if the corpse is not. Increase the DC by +5 for each subsequent question after the second. If you're using this spell during battle, each question and answer requires a round.

>_Note:_ Just as with the _séance_ ability of the Death Priest talent, there's always a 10% chance that the spirit summoned is going to lie to you for reasons best known to it and to the GM. The GM rolls a d20 secretly before the corpse provides any answers; a 3+ means the spirit will speak truly, but a 1 or a 2 means it will lie while appearing to be aiming for the truth.

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle, poisonous fumes from the deepest recesses of the Underworld pour onto the battlefield. At the start of their turn, each enemy on the battlefield takes 30 poison damage (save for half). Allies must succeed at an easy save (6+) or take 10 poison damage.

Any creature that is reduced to 0 hp or below by the poison remains conscious, but they are confused (attacking their own allies). If a confused creature takes damage, or if they are healed above zero hit points, the confusion effect ends. Confused creatures take no damage from the poison.

Increase the damage against enemies who fail their save by 5 times the escalation die.

### Siphon Ultimate Power

Ranged spell

Daily

**Effect:** Ask one nearby ally per point of escalation die if they are willing to support your casting of the spell. For each willing ally, you gain an extra standard action this turn, and you can use one of their spells or powers. If that power is not at-will, it is expended. You can replace any ability score in the power’s description with Intelligence. You only gain the spell or power itself, no other abilities or bonuses that are not part of the description, unless they are required for it to work.

After casting this spell, you take a -1 penalty to all attacks and defenses for each extra action you took (save ends).
