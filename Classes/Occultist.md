# Occultist

There is only one occultist, and your one unique thing should account for your knowledge and mastery of powers hidden and occluded.

## Ability Scores

The occultist gains a +2 class bonus to Intelligence or Wisdom, as long as it isn't the same ability you increase with your +2 species bonus.

## Skills

Occultists get 2 skill points in any Intelligence or Wisdom skill like Craft, History, and Perception.

## Gear

At 1st level, the occultist starts with the embroidered robes, secret scrolls, and runic vestments that you would expect from someone with such arcane power. He might have a small item that looks like a harmless bauble but whose markings become more intricate and mesmerizing the longer it's viewed. To defend himself, he has a staff or a dagger hidden under his robe. He also has some personal possessions left over from his earlier life.

### Gold Pieces

The occultist start with 25gp.

---

## Class Features

### Arcane Implements

You use arcane power to alter fate. While wands and staffs are designed for casting spells that are different from the spells you use, given a little time you can bend such an implement to your will.

#### Epic Feat

If you find a magic weapon that isn't an arcane implement but that calls to your soul, you can bend it to your will and use its attack and damage bonus for spellcasting also. Any other arcane benefits you gain from the weapon are at the GM's discretion.

---

### Delayed Magical Healing

Magical healing effects heal you one round after the effect would normally be applied. You gain the healing at the start of the turn of whoever applied the magical healing effect, or at the start of your next turn if you drank a healing potion or found some other way of magically healing yourself during your last turn. This doesn't apply outside of combat or when you rally.

#### Adventurer Feat

Your baseline hit points are 7 instead of 6.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle when a healing effect would be applied to you, you can roll a save (11+). If you succeed, you get the healing immediately. If you fail, lose a hit point.

#### Epic Feat

Increase your total recoveries by 1. Once per full recovery as a free action when a natural attack roll of 17 or less hits you, you take only half damage from that attack instead.

---

### Focus and Spellcasting

Wielding your arcane power of reality requires two steps. First, you take time to focus your mind. Once you have this focus, you can cast a spell. Casting a spell generally expends your focus, though there will be exceptions depending on the spell.

Gaining your focus requires a standard action, and it draws opportunity attacks just like using a ranged attack does. (The "range" in this case is "beyond this world.") You can cast most of your spells only in response to an event, typically during an enemy's turn or an ally's turn.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you cast a spell and retain your focus, you gain a +2 bonus to all defenses until the start of your next turn.

#### Champion Feat

While you have your focus, when an enemy misses you with an attack, it takes psychic damage equal to your level.

#### Epic Feat

The "retain focus" range of your occultist spells increases by 2 (for example, 1–5 would be 1–7).

---

### Rebuke

With focus, you can pummel someone with their own negative karma. In addition to the spells you normally know based on your level, you also know _karmic rebuke_. There are no feats associated with this spell, but you can improve it with the Superior Rebuke talent.

_Karmic rebuke_ requires a quick action instead of an interrupt action. It's designed so you can cast it during your turn when you've retained your focus, then use your standard action to get your focus back that same turn.

#### Karmic Rebuke

Close-quarters Spell

**At-Will**
Quick action to cast

Expend Focus

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** 1d6 + Wisdom psychic damage.

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | 3d6 damage. |
| 5th | 5d6 damage. |
| 7th | 5d8 damage. |
| 9th | 7d10 damage. |

---

### Uniqueness

You're the only occultist. Your one unique thing should address your identity as the occultist, but you need to contribute your own personal take on the character just like you would with a dwarf fighter or other character class. A character's _unique_ concerns story material beyond a class description, yours included.

---

### Spell Choices and Flexible Recharge

Like a standard spellcaster, you choose the spells you will be able to cast after each full heal-up. When you successfully recharge a spell, you can regain any spell of that spell's level, not necessarily the same spell again. In effect, you roll to recharge that level's spell slot.

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per full recovery, you can automatically succeed on a recharge roll that's 6+ (but not 11+ or 16+).

#### Champion Feat

Once per full recovery when you recharge a spell (usually during a quick rest), you can make a recharge roll for a recharge spell even if you haven't expended that spell (allowing you to have an additional use of that spell available).

#### Epic Feat

Once per full recovery, you can automatically succeed on a recharge roll.

---

## Class Talents

Choose four of the following class talents. You get an additional occultist class talent at 5th level, and again at 8th level.

### Air of Exuberance

You can replace Intelligence with Charisma when casting your occultist spells. You also gain [Charm Person](./Wizard.md#charm-person) as a bonus spell at your class level.

#### Adventurer Feat

Whenever you retain focus with an Occultist spell, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier, twice at 5th level, and thrice at 8th).

#### Champion Feat

When you hit an enemy with Karmic Rebuke, deal psychic damage equal to your level to a different nearby enemy.

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle, when you are missed by an attack, the attacker takes the miss effect, and you take no damage.

---

### Blade of Castigation

You gain the Martial Rebuke power, which you can use instead of Karmic Rebuke to expend your focus on your turn.

#### Martial Rebuke

Close-quarters Spell

At-will

Quick action

expends focus

**Effect:** Make a basic melee attack.

##### Adventurer Feat

On a natural 5, 10, 15, or 20 on the attack roll, you can teleport to a nearby location after making the attack.

##### Champion Feat

Increase the WEAPON damage dice of the attack by one step (1d4 to 1d6 for a dagger, or 1d8 to 1d10 for a longsword).

##### Epic Feat

If the target is staggered, increase your critical threat range with this attack by your Intelligence modifier.

---

### Brain-Melting Secrets

When you hit with a spell attack that deals psychic damage, one target of the attack can't attack you during its next turn this battle unless you are the only nearby enemy.

#### Adventurer Feat

The effect works whenever you hit an enemy with a spell, not only one that deals psychic damage.

#### Champion Feat

You are immune to the confused and dazed conditions. In addition, charm, fear, sleep, and similar mental effects have no effect on you.

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle when you deal psychic damage to an enemy, if it has 300 hp or fewer, you can also weaken it (save ends).

---

### Child of Prophecy

Gain a bonus occultist spell.

Choose a damage type, such as physical weapons or fire. You are vulnerable to this damage type.

#### Adventurer Feat

Gain a 3-point skill related to the prophecy.

#### Champion Feat

Gain the adventurer feats of all occultist spells you know.

#### Epic Feat

Gain the champion feats of all occultist spells you know.

---

### Hewer of Truth

You can use an edged melee weapon without an attack penalty. You can use Intelligence instead of Strength for your attack rolls with that weapon, and Wisdom instead of Strength for your damage rolls. In addition, when you hit an enemy engaged with you with a spell, you can cause a small amount of extra harm to that foe with your weapon. The target takes ongoing damage equal to your melee attack miss damage.

#### Adventurer Feat

Twice per full recovery when an enemy engaged with you misses you with an attack, you can deal ongoing damage to it equal to your Wisdom modifier + Level as you give it a quick slice you're your weapon, double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level, and triple it at 8th level.

#### Champion Feat

While you have your focus, you gain a +4 bonus to opportunity attacks.

#### Epic Feat

Once per full recovery when you hit an enemy with _karmic rebuke_, you can make a basic melee attack as a free action.

---

### Icon Channeler

_Special:_ You cannot take this talent if you have taken the Icon Envoy talent.

You have three fewer relationship points than normal (i.e. none at adventurer tier, one at champion tier, and two at epic tier). Instead, when all the characters get to allocate relationship points, you get an advantage as though you have 3 points with any one occult relationship you choose. Like any other character, you can gain occult relationship points through extraordinary story events. Remember, just because an occult relationship is out to kill you doesn't mean you have negative relationship points. Points represent the utility of a connection in the story not its strength. If you encounter occult relationships other than the standard ones, you can probably talk the GM into letting you align your soul to them, but expect it to cost you.

#### Adventurer Feat

Choose three occult relationships when you take this feat. Each time you apply the effects of Icon Channeler to occult relationships, you gain an advantage as though you had 6 points with those occult relationships.

#### Champion Feat

As the adventurer feat, except that you can also choose three more occult relationships (six total).

#### Epic Feat

Each time you apply the effects of Icon Channeler to occult relationships, you gain an advantage as though you had 9 points with those occult relationships.

---

### Icon Envoy

_You cannot take this talent if you have taken the_ Icon Channeler _talent._

Each time characters get to barter for relationship advantages and roll a persuasion check, declare which player will get at least a 16 with one of their relationships before the rolls. The player rolls one of their checks for that relationship before the others. That first roll counts as a 16 unless that player rolls higher. Roll all other relationship checks normally.

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per level, instead of working with the relationships your ally has, give an ally a 16 with a relationship they don't already have a relationship with.

#### Champion Feat

If the first roll for the called relationship is even, it counts as a 20 instead of a 16.

#### Epic Feat

If the first roll for the called relationship is odd, you can declare a second player and one of their relationships, and have them roll one persuasion check the same way.

---

### Karmic Cure

You gain the Karmic Cure power, which you can use instead of Karmic Rebuke to expend your focus on your turn.

---

#### Karmic Cure

Close-quarters Spell

At-will

Quick action

Expends focus

**Effect:** You or a nearby ally can use a recovery to heal.

##### Adventurer Feat

Add your Wisdom modifier to the amount healed, twice at 5th level, and thrice at 8th).

##### Champion Feat

The recoveries granted by this ability use exploding dice (roll an extra die for each that comes up as maximum).

##### Epic Feat

If the escalation die is odd, the target can spend a second recovery. If it is even, a second target can spend a recovery.

---

### Knight of the Abyssal Gate

You can wear heavy armor and use a shield at no attack penalty.

#### Adventurer Feat

Gaining focus no longer provokes an opportunity attack.

#### Champion Feat

Increase your recovery dice to d8.

#### Epic Feat

While you have focus, you have a +1 bonus to all defenses.

---

### Otherworld Shadow

A shadow self haunts and lurks near you most of the time, sometimes an actual shadow on a wall, but other times only a presence sensed just over your shoulder. Once per full recovery as an interrupt action, negate all damage and effects from an enemy's attacks against you that turn as your shadow absorbs them. Using this talent's power means you avoid damage from a monster's multiple attacks if it has them. It also works against multiple attacks from mooks in the same mob working on the same initiative count, but not attacks from multiple non-mook monsters.

#### Adventurer Feat

Your shadow grants you greater personal resilience: increase your total recoveries by 1.

#### Champion Feat

Once per full recovery as a free action, you can end all ongoing damage affecting you as you pass off the damage to your shadow.

#### Epic Feat

Once per full recovery as a free action, you gain a _fear aura_ that affects each enemy attacking you or engaged with you. The hit point threshold for the fear effect is the standard value for a monster five levels above you. Allies are not subject to the fear effect unless they cast a spell that targets you or otherwise interact with you directly in some way. Even in this case, that ally can spend a move action to be immune to your shadow's _fear aura_ for one round.

| **PC Level** | **Fear Threshold HP (Level + 5)** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | 30 |
| **2** | 36 |
| **3** | 48 |
| **4** | 60 |
| **5** | 72 |
| **6** | 96 |
| **7** | 120 |
| **8** | 144 |
| **9** | 192 |
| **10** | 230 |

---

### Planar Chaos

Whenever you roll a natural 1, 7, 13 or 19 on a d20 roll for an occultist spell, you can roll on the psion [High Weirdness table](./Psion.md#high-weirdness-table) and gain an at-will psion spell of up to your level, which you can cast once that battle. Roll 1d6 to see whether you get an attack (1-2), defense (3-4), or iconic spell (5-6). You can choose iconic spells from any icon that you have a relationship with.

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per battle, gain a once-per-battle psion spell instead. In addition, you can use this talent without rolling for High Weirdness.

#### Champion Feat

Once per full recovery, gain a full recovery psion spell instead.

#### Epic Feat

When you gain a psion spell with this talent, also roll 1d6 on the warp talent for that spell type.

---

### Reeds of Rectitude

You can use a ranged weapon without attack penalty. You can use Intelligence instead of Strength for your attack rolls with that weapon, and Wisdom instead of Strength for your damage rolls.

You can also target far away enemies with your occultist spells that only target nearby enemies, at a -2 penalty to the attack roll.

#### Adventurer Feat

If you also have the Blade of Castigation talent, you can make a basic ranged attack with Martial Rebuke, instead of a melee attack.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, when you miss with a ranged weapon attack, deal half damage.

#### Epic Feat

While you have focus, you ignore the resistances of any enemy you attack with a ranged weapon attack.

---

### Stance of Necessity

Twice per full recovery as a quick action, you can gain a +4 bonus to all defenses. The protection lasts until the end of the battle and is in effect while you do NOT have your focus. The bonus also ends when an attack hits you while you don't have your focus.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can guard a nearby ally instead of yourself (you don't have to see that ally). The defense bonus ends if either you or the ally is hit while you don't have your focus.

#### Champion Feat

Your Stance of Necessity uses are now recharge 16+ instead of full recovery.

#### Epic Feat

When an enemy misses you with an attack while you don't have your focus, it takes psychic damage equal to triple your Wisdom modifier + Level.

---

### Superior Rebuke

The first time each round that you expend your focus to cast a spell as an interrupt action and fail to retain your focus, roll a d20 afterward. On an 18–20, you can also cast _karmic rebuke_ as a free action, using that roll in place of your attack roll. You can use this talent again during a later round in the battle once you have your focus again.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can also make the _karmic rebuke_ attack when the d20 roll is 2–4 (low monster MD plus an escalation die bonus often means you'll still hit).

#### Champion Feat

You can also make a _karmic rebuke_ attack as a free action when you roll a natural 5, 10, 15, or 20 on initiative, even if you don't have your focus.

#### Epic Feat

One battle per full recovery as a free action, you can enhance your _karmic__rebuke_. When you enhance it, enemies are vulnerable (crit range expands by 2) to your _karmic rebuke_ attacks until the end of the battle or until you score a critical hit with the attack.

---

### Unwinding the Soul

When you cast a spell and roll a natural 11+ with the attack, after the attack you can "unwind" the target as a free action, making it vulnerable to your attacks until the end of the battle. You can unwind only one enemy at a time, so if you choose to unwind a different enemy, the previous foe is no longer vulnerable to your attacks.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can now unwind a second enemy, but if you unwind a third, the first enemy is no longer vulnerable. You can also take this feat multiple times, allowing you to unwind another enemy each time you select it.

#### Champion Feat

You can now unwind an enemy with any attack roll other than a natural 1 when you cast a spell, instead of only on an 11+.

#### Epic Feat

When you attack an enemy that you have begun to unwind and roll a natural 11+ against it, it takes extra psychic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier + Level from all subsequent hits by you or your allies.

---

### Vengeful Mind Shard

Choose a flexible attack from the fighter class, of up to your level. However, instead of basic attacks, you trigger this maneuver with the attack roll of your Karmic Rebuke class feature.

If you have the Blade of Castigation talent, you can trigger the maneuver with Martial Rebuke.

#### Adventurer Feat

Choose a fighter talent that can be used once per battle. You can use this talent once per full recovery, but you must expend your focus to do so.

#### Champion Feat

Gain a second fighter maneuver, two levels lower than your class level.

#### Epic Feat

The first time you use Karmic Rebuke (or Martial Rebuke) in a battle, you have advantage on the attack roll.

---

### Warp Flesh

When you cast a spell that targets Mental Defense and the target has a higher MD than PD, the attack "twists" and targets PD instead. When a spell twists this way, it deals force damage instead of its normal damage type.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you cast a spell that twists, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

#### Champion Feat

When you score a critical hit with a spell, the target also takes ongoing force damage equal to double your Wisdom modifier (triple it at 8th level). The ongoing damage isn't doubled by the crit.

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle when you hit an enemy with a spell, you can negate all of the target's resistances (hard save ends, 16+). This effect occurs even if the target's PD is higher than its MD.

---

### Watch the World Burn

Change all psychic damage you deal to fire damage, and the damage dice are exploding dice (roll any die that shows up as the maximum again and add the reroll).

#### Adventurer Feat

When you target an enemy with an occultist spell, and you would retain focus, you can expend your focus instead and deal 1d6 per level (exploding dice) fire damage to the target. You can do this even on a miss.

#### Champion Feat

Whenever you roll extra damage dice from exploding dice, also deal the extra damage to a second nearby enemy.

#### Epic Feat

Once per full recovery, attack one nearby enemy per Intelligence modifier with an occultist spell that only has one target.

### Army of Me

Close-quarters Spell

Recharge 16+ after battle

**Effect:** Spend up to three recoveries. Instead of healing, summon a copy of yourself in a nearby location for each recovery you spend. Each copy‘s hit points are equal to the recovery roll. These copies are dimension-shifted copies of yourself. They can take a move and standard action, and they can make weapon attacks, but all damage they do is halved. Only you can gain focus and cast spells. Clones are destroyed if they are reduced to zero hit points or below. If you are killed, you can transfer yourself into one of your clones. At the end of the battle, you merge with your clones. Add up all hit points and discard any above your maximum.

#### Champion Feat

Each living clone increases the retain focus range of your spells by 1.

## 9th Level Spells

### Butterfly Effect

Close-quarters Spell

Full Recovery

**Effect:** You summon a colorful butterfly that flaps its wings once. This sets a chain of connected events in motion. You determine the general outcome of each event (“Snow is falling on Dragon Peak”), but not the details. The connection does not have to be obvious, as your magic works in mysterious ways. Each step in the chain takes up to a full full recovery to resolve. After each event, roll a d20. If the roll is equal to the number of events caused by the spell, or lower, the spell ends. You cannot end the spell voluntarily — a high enough roll always causes the next event.

However, the spell does not end on a roll of natural 1. On a natural 1, the spell spins out of control, and you reroll the die. From that point on, you still describe the event, but there is some catastrophic twist, and each subsequent 1 only makes it worse. These unforeseen consequences are described by other players, starting with the person on your left.

Close-quarters Spell

**Effect:** Increase the escalation die by 1.

**Retain Focus:** —.

#### Epic Feat

The spell now triggers when the escalation die is 2–5.

### Rewind the Skeins

Close-quarters Spell

Once per level

Standard action to cast; you can only cast this spell out of battle

**Trigger:** You realize that the last two minutes of out of battle roleplay or existence have gone horribly wrong and you want to rewind and try to redirect reality in a manner that you wish.

**Effect:** Reality goes back two minutes. You remember what happened the first time. No one else does. This effect usually can't rewind past battles—it's designed for reliving or avoiding social interactions, roleplaying moments, traps, non-combat events, earthquakes, tarrasque appearances (if you could use it before rolling initiative!), and even relationship advantage rolls.

#### Epic Feat

Take it back five minutes.

### Temporal Anomaly

Close-quarters Spell

Recharge 16+ after battle

Expend focus

**Trigger:** A nearby enemy rolls a natural 1–5 on an attack.

**Target:** The triggering enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** 7d10 + Wisdom psychic damage, and a nearby ally can make a free standard action attack against the target.

**Miss:** Half damage, and allies engaged with the target can pop free.

**Retain Focus:** 1–5 (first attack roll only)

#### Epic Feat

A second nearby ally can also make an attack against the target.

### Transcendent Ascendance

Close-quarters spell; Once per life; No action

**Trigger:** You fail your last death save.

_Special:_ You can cast this spell while unconscious.

**Effect:** You unshackle yourself from your decaying physical body. Not dead, not undead, you continue to exist on a different plane of existence. You can still manifest as a ghost-like apparition, but your attention is now elsewhere, beyond the trifles of mortals. Other PCs can now choose you as an icon relation or worship you as a god.
