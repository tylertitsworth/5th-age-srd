## Class Features

### Barred School

As a specialist wizard, choose one of the seven wizard schools Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, or Transmutation as your barred school. You cannot cast spells from that school.

---

### Cantrips

Every wizard can cast a handful of cantrips each full recovery. You don't have to memorize or choose them beforehand, you just cast them on the fly.

Wizards can cast a number of cantrips equal to their Intelligence modifier each battle. Each cantrip takes a standard action to cast as a ranged spell. Outside of battle, a wizard can cast about three to six cantrips every five minutes. The Cantrip Mastery talent speeds up cantrip casting.

| **Tier** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- |
| Adventurer | Cantrips with a standard duration last 10–60 minutes, plus 10 minutes per wizard level. The GM rolls and the wizard becomes aware that their cantrip is about to end a couple minutes before it's done. |
| Champion tier | Most cantrips last 1–6 hours. |
| Epic Tier | Most cantrips last 2–12 hours. |

---

### Cloud Spells

Cloud spells create a fog in the nearby area. These spells usually attack a number of nearby enemies and have some effect on allies engaged with these targets.

After the fog is created, non-engaged creatures can move out of it as a move action. Engaged creatures must succeed at a disengage check to do so.

At the start of your next turn after casting the spell, make a normal save (11+) to check whether the cloud persists. This is not an action. If it persists, any target that was hit and is still in the cloud suffers the effect again, and you make another save at the start of the following turn. If the save fails, the spell ends.

At the GM’s discretion, clouds move naturally with the terrain. They will roll down slopes and disperse in strong winds.

---

### Cyclic Spells

Spells that have a cyclic usage can always be cast at least once per battle, and are only expended in that battle if they are cast when the escalation die is 0 or odd. In other words, if you cast a cyclic spell like color spray or rebuke when the escalation die is even, the spell is not expended and can still be cast later in the battle.

---

### Ritual Magic

Wizards can cast arcane [rituals](../General-Rules/Rituals.md).

#### Champion Feat

You can master a ritual in half the required time.

---

### Specialist Advantage

Full Recovery spells of your chosen school become recharge 16+ after battle. They still count as full recovery spells for abilities that trigger off full recovery spells.

#### Champion Feat

Gain a +1 bonus to recharge rolls for spells of your school.

#### Epic Feat

The bonus to recharge rolls is now equal to your Intelligence modifier.

---

### Specialist Spell Slot

When you choose spells during a full heal-up, you can declare one (and only one) of your spell slots as your specialist school slot. You don’t choose a spell for that slot after the full heal-up, but at the time of casting the spell. You can choose any normal spell that belongs to your specialist school.

If the spell you cast is a recharge spell, make a recharge roll at the end of the battle to regain the spell slot, not the particular spell. If the spell you cast is once per battle, cyclic, or at-will, you cast the spell normally during the battle, then regain the spell slot at the end of the battle.

---

### Wizard Schools

The seven schools of magic are Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, and Transmutation. Choose one of the schools as your specialty.

Choose three of the following class talents.

Whenever you cast a full recovery wizard spell, you gain a +4 AC bonus until the end of your next turn.

#### Adventurer Feat

The bonus also applies to your Physical Defense.

#### Champion Feat

You gain 2d12 temporary hit points each time you cast a full recovery spell.

#### Epic Feat

The bonus also applies to Mental Defense.

---

### Arcane Archaeologist

You gain 5 points in skills that covers knowledge of ancient civilizations, locating treasure sites, and identifying what you find. You are familiar enough with ancient writing systems that you can decipher most writings you find on maps, dungeon walls, and item inscriptions.

Once per battle or scene, as a move action, you can pull off a stunt that you have learned when exploring dangerous ruins, things like climbing slippery surfaces, jumping narrow ledges, and avoiding massive rolling boulders. Describe how you are using a mixture of athletic training and arcane tricks to avoid the danger. Usually, you can pull off the stunt without any skill check, but the GM can require a roll for absolutely outlandish tricks.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain the rogue’s Trap Sense class feature.

#### Champion Feat

Add your Intelligence modifier to magic item power recharge rolls for items you wield. This represents your familiarity with ancient artifacts.

#### Epic Feat

You have advantage on saves against effects that were caused by magic items and traps.

---

### Beguiler

When you cast a spell that targets MD, choose one of the following benefits:

- If the spell deals damage, deal extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier (x2 at 5th level; x3 at 8th) to each target you hit.
- Increase the difficulty for the target’s first save against the spell by your Charisma modifier. (A natural roll of 18+ always saves, however.)
- Increase the hit point limit for the creatures you can affect by 5 times your level if the spell has one target, and twice your level if it has multiple targets.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain 3 points toward skills that represents performance skills or mental manipulation.

#### Champion Feat

Choose a class. You can switch out a wizard spell for a spell from the chosen class at a -2 level penalty, as long as that spell targets MD.

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle, when the escalation die is 3+, you can gain all three of the beguiler benefits with one spell.

---

### Bladesinger

You can use light and heavy one-handed melee weapons without attack penalty, and if the weapon is a true magic item, you can use it as an implement for wizard spells. If you are a hybrid, you are considered a “skillful warrior” for these weapons and don’t suffer a reduced damage die with them.

You are also trained in light armors, and increase your base AC with them to 12.

However, the focus on martial training has reduced your time to study the arcane arts, and you have one fewer wizard spell slots of your highest level available.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you wield a one-handed blade weapon, your ranged spells do not provoke opportunity attacks.

#### Champion Feat

After casting an arcane spell, your next hit or miss with a melee weapon attack deals extra damage equal to the spell level. This bonus is not cumulative, only use the highest bonus.

#### Epic Feat

As a quick action, you can enter a defensive stance that gives you a +1 bonus to AC until the end of your next turn, and a +1 bonus to the first melee attack on your next turn.

---

### Cantrip Mastery

Cantrips are at-will spells for you.

Unlike normal wizards, who use a standard action to cast a cantrip, you can cast a cantrip as a quick action.

To do something particularly cunning or surprising with one of your cantrips where the GM isn't sure whether you could pull off that use of the spell, roll a normal save (11+) to cast the spell the way you envision it.

Additionally, you can expend a 3rd level spell slot or higher to choose one cantrip per spell slot you have given up and create a once-per-full recovery related effect with it that is much greater, if you and your GM can agree on a cool effect that suits the cantrip.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can use cantrip-style versions of any wizard spell you have memorized. When you expend a spell, however, you can't make cantrip-style use of it any more. The key is that none of these uses should be combat relevant or deal damage.

The Cantrip Mastery talent is more about enhance the roleplaying and less about combat usefulness.

---

### Deep Specialization

_Special:_ You cannot take both this talent and Dual Specialization.

When you prepare your specialist spell slot, you can use it to cast two spells instead of one.

#### Adventurer Feat

You have advantage on skill checks regarding spells of your specialist school.

#### Champion Feat

When you take a quick rest, and you don’t have any spells left except at-will spells, you can regain your specialist school bonus spell slot. Take a cumulative -1 penalty to PD and MD from exhaustion until your next full heal-up.

#### Epic Feat

Gain the lowest tier feat of all spells of your specialist school for free.

---

### Destiny Manipulation

You've studied the movements of the stars, correlated the signs and portends, and learned the forbidden fate-warping magic.

Once per full recovery, you may allow yourself or an ally to reroll a d20 with a +4 bonus by changing fate. However, this manipulation of destiny has a cost. After the battle or scene in which you enabled a reroll, attempt an easy save (6+). If you succeed, nothing horrible happens, congratulations on your prescient reroll.

If you fail the save, you, or someone in the adventuring party, or more rarely, an NPC or place you care about, take a big loss— something horrible happens that isn’t directly related to the fight or problem you were just dealing with.

Each loss gives you an option: you can choose to make it slightly less of a loss by having the problem magically tie back to your predictions. Or you can erase all traces of your manipulation, so that not even your fellow player characters have any idea, but the loss will be just as bad as it was going to be.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +1 bonus on the destiny manipulation save.

#### Champion Feat

You can now use destiny manipulation twice a full recovery.

#### Epic Feat

You can now use destiny manipulation on your enemy’s rolls.

---

### Dual Specialization

_Special:_ You cannot take both this talent and Deep Specialization.

Choose two specialist schools instead of just one. You gain the specialist spell slot and specialist recharge abilities for both schools. For the specialist slot, you can prepare two slots, one for each of your two schools.

You must also choose two barred schools.

#### Adventurer Feat

Before casting a spell of one specialist school, you can spend a quick action to add a small effect from your other specialist school. For example, you could use illusion to make an evocation spell seem scarier and more dangerous, or add an abjuration effect to a summoned monster to shore up its defenses.

#### Champion Feat

Gain the adventurer tier feat of all spells from both of your specialist schools.

---

### Evoker

Once per battle, when you cast a spell that targets Physical Defense, before rolling for the number of targets or making the spell's attack roll, you can expend your quick action to evoke the spell. Hit or miss, you'll max out the spell's damage dice (except on a natural one, which deals no damage to the target and likely damages the caster in some manner).

#### Champion Feat

Whenever you evoke a spell, you can reroll one of the attack rolls if that natural roll was less than or equal to the escalation die. You must take the new result.

---

### Hedge Wizard

After each full heal-up, roll on the table below.

| **d8** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A blood sacrifice strengthens your body over your mind. You gain one less wizard spell this time. However, you gain a +2 bonus to PD and roll d8s for recovery dice until the next full heal-up. |
| 2 | You bond with a protective spirit. Gain a +1 bonus to saves until your next full heal-up. |
| 3 | You bond with an earth spirit. Gain a full recovery terrain caster spell from the terrain you are currently in. |
| 4 | You bond with a life spirit. The first time you are reduced below zero hit points before your next full heal-up, immediately heal using a free recovery. |
| 5 | You have an out-of-body experience. Immediately gain the incremental advance you would gain at the end of the session. (This does not allow you to level up yet). |
| 6 | You have a prophetic dream about an upcoming conflict. For one battle before the next full heal-up, set the escalation die to 1 at the start of your first turn. |
| 7 | You reach into the past. Choose one spell that you had not expended before the heal-up and gain it as a bonus spell. If you have none, reroll. |
| 8 | The stars are aligned for one spell of your choice. You can reroll one of your attack rolls with that spell before your next full heal-up. |

#### Adventurer Feat

When casting a ritual, you can expend a recovery without healing to gain advantage on the check. Describe how your ritual is physically exhausting, through dance, sweating, loss of blood, etc.

#### Champion Feat

Roll twice on the table and choose one of the results.

#### Epic Feat

Get a spell from a different spellcasting class as a bonus spell, at your class level minus 2. This represents your study of primal wizardry that does not conform to modern limitations.

---

### High Arcana

Your study of the highest orders of magic gives you options that lesser wizards cannot match: Memorization and a bonus spell: counter-magic

---

#### Memorization

When you pick your spells, you can choose any full recovery wizard spell twice (instead of once). This doesn't apply to spells that start as recharge spells. For example, at 7th level when you have five 7th level spells and four 5th level spells, you could choose fireball twice as a 7th level spell, or once as a 7th level spell and once as a 5th level spell. (Your 3rd level spell slot can't be used for fireball because fireball starts as a 5th level spell.)

---

#### Counter-magic

Close-quarters Spell

Once per battle

Free action to cast

**Trigger:** A nearby creature you can see casts a spell.

**Target:** The nearby creature casting a spell.

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target's spell is canceled, and the caster loses the action they were using for the spell. If the spell had a limited use, that use is expended if your natural attack roll is even.

#### Champion Feat

You can now cast _counter-magic_ twice per battle.

#### Epic Feat

You can now cast _counter-magic_ in reaction to a creature using any magical ability, not just casting a spell.

---

### Monster Ecologist

You gain a 5-point skill related to the academic knowledge of fantastic creatures.

Once per battle, as a free action on your turn, gain a flash of insight about a creature. Choose from the list below:

- Learn details of an attack, power, or nastier special (GM’s choice).
- Understand its true desires or motives for fighting.
- Find out the condition under which it would negotiate, surrender, or flee.
- Know about weaknesses or resistances.

#### Adventurer Feat

If the creature is an aberration, beast, dragon, elemental or ooze, you can learn two facts about it.

#### Champion Feat

You can use this talent twice per battle.

#### Epic Feat

After using this talent on a target, gain a +1 bonus to attacks against it.

---

### Muscle Wizard

You can make unarmed attacks without penalty, and your unarmed damage dice are d6s. Once per battle, when you hit with an unarmed attack, you can deal fire, force, or lightning damage with the attack, increase the damage dice to d10s, and force the target to pop free from you.

When you cast a ranged spell, you don’t trigger attacks of opportunity from engaged enemies that you target with the spell.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you miss a spell attack against a target you are engaged with, deal damage equal to your Strength modifier (x2 at 5th level; x3 at 8th) to it.

#### Champion Feat

Increase your recovery dice to d8s.

#### Epic Feat

Increase the damage dice of your once-per-battle unarmed attack to d20s.

---

### Necroblast

Once per full recovery, before you cast a spell, you may declare it to be a necroblast. The spell’s damage type becomes necrotic damage in addition to its usual type. If any non-undead nonmooks are destroyed by the spell, they become undead under your control.

In battle, these undead creatures crumble at the end of their next turn, or if they are hit by any other attack, but may make a move and a basic attack under your control. The creatures are considered weakened (–4 to attacks and defenses).

Alternatively, if you do not wish to force the creatures to fight for you, the undead creature will perform one brief service for you after the battle before crumbling, like answering a question, guiding you a short distance, carrying you across some obstacle, or a brief improvised entertainment.

If no creatures are destroyed by the necroblast, you gain no added benefit.

#### Adventurer Feat

If you don’t kill any non-mooks with the spell, your necroblast ability isn’t expended.

#### Champion Feat

Reanimated creatures aren’t weakened.

#### Epic Feat

The service you demand out of battle doesn’t have to be a brief one. Instead, they serve you at least until your next full heal-up, and possibly longer. Creatures who are forced to serve still won’t fight for you.

---

### Necromancy

You can switch one of your wizard spells for a spell of the same level from the [necromancer list](./Necromancer.md#1st-level-spells). Starting at third level, you can switch out additional spells at a -2 level penalty.

You know how to unravel the magic that creates undead. You gain a +1 bonus to attacks against them.

#### Adventurer Feat

Understanding the undead helps you ward them off. You gain a +1 bonus to defenses against undead.

#### Champion Feat

Add your Intelligence modifier to the first death save you roll in a battle. If you roll a natural 20 on any death save. you also regain an expended spell.

#### Epic Feat

When you kill an enemy with a spell, siphon off some of their life. Gain a +1 bonus to your critical threat range until the end of the battle. This bonus resets to zero when you score a critical hit.

---

### Polysyllabic Verbalizations

Rename each of your full recovery and recharge spells. Think up the most over-the-top and extravagant names you can muster. Since these alternate spells are so lengthy, they take an additional quick action to cast. While the regular effects of the spells are the same as the more common versions, they have a small bonus effect appropriate to the situation.

The bonus effect is determined by the GM, or by a collaboration between the GM and the player. It should add to the storytelling power of the situation.

The bonus effect should suit the name of the spell or the way it's delivered, and shouldn't precisely match up with what the spell normally accomplishes.

---

### Scion of Horizon

Your close ties in wizard society give you an extra positive relationship point with a wizardly icon.

Due to your pure wizard blood, combined with the excellent training you have enjoyed, you gain a bonus spell slot at the highest level you can cast. However, you also have one less recovery (usually 7).

#### Adventurer Feat

You have met many wizards, which gives you an easy read on them. When meeting an arcane spellcaster for the first time, ask one question about them, which the GM will answer truthfully. Typical questions are their school specialization, their icon affiliation, or the spell signature that marks their spells.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a +1 bonus to all defenses against spells and magical attacks.

---

### Sheltered Apprentice

Intelligence-based skill checks are one step easier (-5) for you. This includes checks about niche academics and esoteric lore, but also arcane knowledge and skill checks required for ritual casting. Once per full recovery, you can perform a stunt to remember an otherwise useless fact from an obscure tome you’ve read. This is allows you to automatically succeed on what would otherwise be a ridiculously hard task. The GM should encourage the player to make up pieces of lore for the game world with this talent.

However, you also choose one ability score where all skill checks are one step more difficult. You’re either frail (Strength), clumsy (Dexterity), sickly (Constitution), lacking in empathy (Wisdom) or socially awkward (Charisma).

#### Adventurer Feat

Choose a very narrowly defined scholarly background, and gain one skill point in a related skill per word in the name of your background, ignoring trivial words like “the”, for up to 7 skill points. Examples include the revised taxonomy of butterflies in the Eldeen Reaches, cultural implications of the seasonal migration patterns of Koru Behemoths, or tribal animism and worship among Iron Sea merfolk.

#### Champion Feat

When you spend a feat to improve a wizard spell, you also gain the benefits of any other feat of that spell up to your current tier.

#### Epic Feat

Once per full recovery, you can perform an arcane ritual for half of the normal component cost, but you still need a focus worth the entire cost as relevant.

---

### Spellslinger

You gain a +2 bonus to your critical threat range with wizard at-will spells.

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per full recovery per point of Dexterity modifier, you can reroll an attack roll with an at-will spell.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, when the escalation die is 3+, you can cast an at-will spell as a quick action.

#### Epic Feat

As per the champion tier feat, but you can cast the spell as an interrupt when you are attacked. If you hit, your attacker has disadvantage on their attack roll.

---

### Summoner

When you spend a quick action to control a summoned creature (which allows it to add the escalation die to attack rolls), it also deals extra damage equal to its level, on both hit and miss.

Creatures you summon have one recovery. When healed, they use your recovery roll to determine how many hit points they regain. They can use the rally action to heal, or be healed using healing spells and potions.

#### Adventurer Feat

Your summoned creatures gain a +1 bonus to all saves.

#### Champion Feat

Your summoned creatures have a second recovery.

#### Epic Feat

Your summoned creatures gain a +1 bonus to all defenses.

---

### Typomancy

Choose a type from among Fire, Acid, Cold, Lightning, Force, Psychic, or Poison. When you cast a wizard spell that deals damage, you can change the damage type to the chosen type.
>_Note:_ This results in Pyromancy, Acidomancy, Cryomancy, Fulgomancy, Impetomancy, Psychomancy, or Venomancy respectively.

You gain a spell from any class as a bonus spell at the highest level you can cast, as long as that spell deals your chosen type damage or is otherwise connected to that type. If the spell has an attack roll, you can use Intelligence as the ability score.

#### Adventurer Feat

You ignore resistance for your type.

#### Champion Feat

When you take your type of damage from an enemy attack, heal hit points equal to your level.

#### Epic Feat

When the escalation die is 1+ and you cast a spell that does your damage type damage, increase its damage dice by one step.

---

### Thaumaturge

When you cast a spell that targets PD, choose one of the following benefits:

- If the spell deals damage, deal extra damage equal to your Constitution modifier (x2 at 5th level; x3 at 8th) to each target you hit.
- Increase the DC for the target’s first save against the spell by your Constitution modifier. (A natural roll of 18+ always saves, however)
- Increase the hit point limit for the creatures you can affect by 5 times your level if it is one target, or twice your level in case of multiple targets.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain 3 skill points towards a skill in alchemy and the manipulation of forces and matter.

#### Champion Feat

Choose a class. You can switch out a wizard spell for a spell from that class at a -2 level penalty, as long as that spell targets PD.

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle, when the escalation die is 3+, you can gain all three of the thaumaturge benefits with one spell.

---

### Wizard's Familiar

Your familiar is a tiny or small animal or creature that aids your magic and provides companionship. It also provides opportunities for improvisation between you and the GM.

Your familiar is as intelligent as a normal person. It can communicate with you and will stay close you unless you've chosen abilities that let it roam. Your familiar is on your side but it's not perfectly in your control.

If your familiar dies, it can come back to you the next time you get a full heal-up. (The method or story used is between you and the GM.) Alternatively, you can get a new familiar.

Familiars are useless in combat, except as indicated by their abilities. Ordinarily they aren't damaged by enemy attacks and spells unless the story calls for it.

---

#### Familiar Abilities

Choose two of the following abilities for your familiar.

---

##### Agile

You gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity skill checks.

---

##### Alert, Maybe Even Insightful

You gain a +2 bonus to Wisdom skill checks.

---

##### Counter-bite

Each battle, if your familiar is close to you, it bites the first enemy that hits you with a melee attack after that attack, dealing 1d4 damage per level (no attack roll) to that enemy.

---

##### Flight

Your familiar flies as well as a hawk. It doesn't fly that often and usually sticks with you, but it can do so when its other abilities allow.

---

##### Mimic

One battle per full recovery, you gain the use of the species power (without feats) of one nearby ally.

---

##### Poisonous

Once per battle, when you hit an enemy engaged with you, you can add 5 ongoing poison damage per tier to the damage roll.

---

##### Scout

Once per full recovery, your familiar can separate itself from you and make a reconnaissance run of an area or location. Roll an easy skill check for the environment to get your familiar to scout unseen.

---

##### Tough

You gain a +1 save bonus. Tough counts as two familiar abilities.

---

##### Talkative

Your familiar can talk like a person (but the GM speaks for the familiar more than you do).

##### Adventurer Feat

Your familiar gains another ability.

##### Champion Feat

Once per level, if your familiar is close to you, it can cast one of your spells as a free action on your initiative count, even if you have already expended the spell. The spell functions as if you had cast it.

##### Epic Feat

Your familiar gains another ability.

---

## Cantrips

### Alarm (standard duration)

The cantrip creates a minor watch-sprite that can be instructed to scream if someone comes through an area or touches an object. Watch-sprites are notoriously stupid and sleepy, but with the right talking-to they might stay focused for the duration of the spell. At higher levels, the spell might summon little fanged spirits buzzing back and forth serving as both visual and actual deterrents.

### Animated Quill

Animate a quill, a piece of charcoal or similar object to write down words as you instruct it.

### Arcane Mark (standard duration)

The cantrip creates a magical sigil on an object or person. These sigils are usually plain to see, though a deliberately invisible mark can be made. It takes a difficult perception or magic check to notice.

### Deep Pockets

Put an item in a pocket, from where it disappears into a small pocket dimension. The item can be as long as you like, as long as it fits through the pocket’s opening. You can pull the item back out as a quick action at any time. At the end of the cantrip’s duration, or if the physical pocket is destroyed, the item falls out.

### Detect Magic

You notice lingering magic and supernatural effects within your field of vision. If an effect is concealed on purpose, the DM can require a skill check to detect it.

### Erase

Permanently remove non-magical writing or painting from a scroll or a sheet of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces.

### Fire Shaping

Enlarge or reduce a non-magical fire, change its color, shape, or intensity. After the spell ends, the fire returns to its natural shape, determined by the material that is burning.

### Ghost Sound

This spell creates false noises emanating from somewhere nearby. The effect is like an exceptionally good version of throwing your voice, if your voice could create a wide variety of sounds. Attempted distractions with the cantrip are DC 15 challenges in adventurer environments, higher as you move into champion and epic environments. If someone is using ghost sound against the PCs, a Wisdom-based skill check can identify the sound as a magical fake.

### Grease

You create a slippery area where you touch the floor or an object. Anyone who attempts to move through the area or tries to hold on to the object must succeed at a save to do so.

### Gust of Wind

Create a strong puff of air that is sufficient to extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. With a successful skill check, the gust is strong enough to even extinguish lanterns and other protected flames. It pushes back insects and other small flying creatures, smells, and smoke clouds. It does not affect larger creatures except for a dramatic waving of hair and clothing.

### Knock

This cantrip summons a magical servitor three to four times as big as your closed fist that swarms around the door and attempts to punch or push it open (depending on whether you want to be quiet or announce your presence). Success is determined with an Intelligence check against the environment's DC using an appropriate skill. This cantrip does nothing to avoid any traps that might exist.

### Light (standard duration)

This cantrip creates a fairly wide and consistent field of light, up to 30 feet in diameter, though it isn't bright enough to dazzle.

### Locate Minor Object

Divine the location of an object you are very familiar with, within a range of a few meters. This spell is very handy to find keys, glasses, and other things that get lost around the house.

### Mage Hand

This cantrip creates a small telekinetic effect that lasts a round at most. At best it's about half as strong as the wizard's own strongest hand. At worst it's half as strong as the wizard when they're weak from a bad fever.

### Mending

This cantrip summons a variety of tiny (hand-sized and smaller) magical sprites who swarm over a chosen broken object attempting to mend it (over the course of 1–6 rounds). Small-scale repairs like torn wineskins, muddy clothing, a broken handgrip on a sword, and similar repairs that anyone could fix with two to four hours of devoted work gets handled in seconds. More elaborate repairs to complicated objects might require an Intelligence check, or at the GM's discretion could only be possible if the wizard has taken the Cantrip Mastery talent.

### Nascent Magic Aura

Give an item an indeterminate magic aura, which can be noticed if it is examined for the presence of magic. Upon closer examination and a hard difficulty skill check, the examiner can determine that the aura has no other effect than to create the appearance of a magical enchantment.

### Perfume

Create a pleasant smell on the target object, or at least hide a hideous one.

### Prestidigitation

This cantrip produces magic tricks and small illusions. One casting usually gives you a minute of fun. The magic has nowhere near as much real world force as mage hand.

### Quench

This spell can put out nearby small fire sources such as campfire embers and candles, or smother a hem or sleeve someone has carelessly caught aflame. At higher levels, this cantrip can be used on smaller flames that are far away, or put out a large campfire or small bonfire nearby.

### Recall Familiar

You summon your familiar back to your shoulder, or a location next to you, from up to a few hundred feet distance.

### Recording

For the next few minutes, you record the surrounding sounds into a small gem. The gem holds the recorded sound and can replay it as long as the cantrip lasts.

### Spark

This is a minor fire creation spell, enough to light a pipe, or a campfire, or even a page or two of an unprotected spellbook. It doesn't work against living beings or against things that couldn't easily be set on fire with a few seconds of steady application of a candle. The target of the spark has to be nearby and in sight.

### Still Image

You produce an illusory image, roughly the size of a portrait painting, for the standard duration. It’s two-dimensional, doesn’t move, and doesn’t react to touch. You can make the image transparent or opaque.

### Sundial

Summon a small sundial on your open palm that shows the current time, even in places where no sunlight is available.

### Sunshades

Summon a black screen in front of your eyes that blocks excessive sunlight.

### Ventriloquism

You throw your voice to appear to come from a different location. This is especially effective if the target can’t see you speak.

### Adventurer Feat

Double the number of cantrips you know.

### Champion Feat

Triple the number of cantrips your know.

### Animate Armor

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Enchantment

_Special:_ You can only cast this spell outside of battle; it requires 2d4 minutes to cast.

**Target:** A suit of heavy armor

**Effect:** You animate a suit of heavy armor to fight for you as an armor golem, following to the summoning rules. The armor stays animated until it is reduced to zero hit points, or until your next full heal-up. The spell ends, but the armor is not destroyed when it is reduced it to zero hp (unless it makes sense story-wise, e.g. when falling into lava).

By default, the armor uses its gauntlets to attack, and has a d4 damage die with them. However, the armor can also wield melee weapons like a fighter (with the same WEAPON damage dice) and use a shield for +1 AC.

If you cast the spell on a true magic item suit of armor, or equip it with magic items, it benefits from their bonuses and abilities. However, it can only benefit from one item per spell level, and it suffers all item quirks.

While the armor provides strong protection, it has one weakness — when it takes damage, it needs a round to reassemble itself, and cannot attack that turn.

#### Summoned Armor Golem

| Normal 1st level | **Initiative +4; Pummel 6+ vs. AC--1d4 damage (or damage die or equipped weapon)** | **AC** **PD**| **17** **15** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Troop** | _Magic item powers:_ as per equipped items | **MD** **HP** | **11** **22** |
| | _Unstable Enchantment:_ When the armor golem takes damage, it cannot attack on your next turn. Instead, it uses its standard action to heal hit points equal to twice the spell level. | | |

##### Armor Golem Level Advancement

| Level | Initiative | Attack | Damage | AC | PD | MD | HP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | +4 | +6 | 1d4\* | 17 | 15 | 11 | 22 |
| 3rd | +6 | +8 | 3d4\* | 19 | 17 | 13 | 35 |
| 5th | +8 | +11 | 5d4\* | 22 | 20 | 16 | 50 |
| 7th | +10 | +14 | 7d4\* | 25 | 23 | 19 | 80 |
| 9th | +12 | +17 | 9d4\* | 28 | 26 | 22 | 125 |

>\* Increase damage die according to equipped item.

#### Adventurer Feat

Unstable Enchantment now only activates when the armor golem is staggered.

#### Champion Feat

The armor golem now has golem immunities. It can’t be dazed, weakened, confused, made vulnerable, and it ignores ongoing damage.

---

### Blur

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

**Target:** You or one nearby ally

---

### Charm Person

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

**Target:** One nearby creature with 40 hp or fewer

_Special:_ This spell cannot be cast during combat or on a target that has rolled initiative to fight.

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target believes you are their friend until you or your allies take hostile action against them. (Attacking their normal allies is okay.) If you or your allies attack the target or order the target to attack its normal allies, the target can roll a normal save to break the charm effect during its turn each round.

_Special:_ On a miss, the spell is not detectible by most others unless you miss by 4+ or roll a natural 1, in which case the target and its allies knows what you tried to do and will usually be angry about it.

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | Target with 64 hp or fewer. |
| 5th | Target with 96 hp or fewer. |
| 7th | Target with 160 hp or fewer. |
| 9th | Target with 266 hp or fewer. |

**Miss:** You regain the spell during your next quick rest.

| Higher Level | Damage | Color | Ability | Damage Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3rd | 3d12 damage | Opal | Fire | Fire damage | The target takes 5 points of ongoing fire damage per spell level. |
| 3rd | | Amber | Blindness | Necrotic damage | When the target attacks, determine the targets randomly among all nearby creatures (save ends). |
| 5th | 5d12 damage | Emerald | Stinking cloud | Poison damage | The target is dazed (save ends). Deal half damage to 1d3 nearby enemies. |
| 5th | | Turquoise | Magnetism | | Metal objects start clinging to the target. It is hampered (save ends). |
| 7th | 7d12 damage | Sapphire | Paralysis | Lightning damage | The target is stunned (save ends). If the target has more than 150 hit points, it can save against the effect immediately. |
| 7th | | Amethyst | Petrification | Necrotic damage | The target is weakened (save ends). If it fails its fourth save against the spell, it is permanently turn into stone. |
| 9th | 9d12 damage | Ashen | | Necrotic damage | If the target has 150 hit points or less, it dies. Otherwise it takes 50 ongoing necrotic damage. |

### Enlarge Person

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Transmutation

**Target:** One nearby creature

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD (no attack roll required against allies)

**Hit:** The target’s size increases by one step (usually from normal to large), and it has advantage on all Strength-based skill checks. In addition, it increases all WEAPON damage dice by one step. The target also has a +2 bonus to all defenses against attacks that attempt to grab or swallow it. Unwilling targets can save against the effect normally, otherwise the effect ends at the end of the battle or scene.

**Miss:** —

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 5th | You can now increase the target’s size to huge. It takes a -1 penalty to attacks and defenses, but its WEAPON damage dice are increased by an additional step. |

---

### Enlarge/Shrink Object

Ranged Spell

Move action to cast

Recharge: 11+ after battle, or after 10 minutes have passed if used out of combat

**Target:** One nearby object no larger than a human being

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. the PD of the person holding the object or automatic success if the object is unattended.

**Effect:** You either double or halve the size of the target object for your level in rounds (if used outside of combat, the effect lasts for your level in minutes instead). You can’t cause an item to expand or contract in a way that damages other objects or creatures, however—so, for instance, you can’t shrink a creature’s armor to crush it or make a door expand in its frame in order to break down a wall.

If you shrink a creature’s shield, they lose its benefits; if you shrink their weapon, they take a penalty to damage equal to the escalation die + your level when attacking with it.

Enlarging a shield, weapon, or similarly-sized held item requires the target’s holder to take a penalty to attack rolls equal to the escalation die + your level while still holding it.

Either way, the creature has to make a save (11+) or drop the affected item when the spell is cast.

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | All attack and damage penalties for holders of affected items worsen by 2. |
| 5th | Enlarging a held item causes the holder to become stuck (save ends) unless they drop it. Shrinking a held item causes the holder to lose a move action on their next turn out of sheer confusion. |
| 7th | You can target two items held by a single creature; all penalties to the holder stack. |
| 9th | You can now target items held by two different creatures, but no more than two items per creature. |

---

### Expeditious Retreat

Close-quarters Spell

Once per battle

Quick action

Transmutation

**Target:** You

**Effect:** Move to a far away location that you can reach on foot. You do not trigger opportunity attacks and you cannot be intercepted.

#### Adventurer Feat

Until the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to all defenses equal to the escalation die.

---

### Firebolt

Ranged Spell

At-will

Evocation

**Target:** One nearby enemy

_Special:_ You can increase the targets of the spell to 1d3 nearby enemies. This expends the spell for the full recovery.

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 2d6 fire damage

**Miss:** Half damage

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 3rd | 4d6 damage; 1d4 targets if expended |
| 5th | 5d8 damage |
| 7th | 6d10 damage; 1d6 targets if expended |
| 9th | 8d12 damage |

#### Adventurer Feat

If you expend the spell, you can recharge it on a 16+ after the battle.

---

### Fog Cloud

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Cloud

Evocation

**Target:** 1d4 nearby enemies

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** While inside the cloud, any attack made by the target or against the target has disadvantage, unless the attack is at engaged range. Any creature engaged with the target is also under this effect, i.e. it attacks by it and against it have disadvantage unless at engaged range.

**Cloud:** A creature that is not engaged can leave the cloud as a move action. At the start of your next turn, make a normal save (11+) to check whether the cloud persists. This is not an action. If it persists, the effect continues, and you make another check at the start of the following turn.

#### Adventurer Feat

The save to see if the cloud persists is now an easy save (6+).

#### Champion Feat

You can now target 1d4+2 enemies.

---

### Hostile Probe

Ranged Spell

At-will

Divination

### Contingency

Close-quarters Spell

Full Recovery

Evocation

**Target:** You

**Effect:** Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect.

For example, you could set a contingency to trigger water breathing when you are drowning.

Triggering the contingent spell does not take an action from you. It takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then contingency ends.

The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others.

A shrunken creature loses one quarter of its current hit points from its current total, and increases its AC by 1 and its PD by 3. Its weapon attacks deal half the normal damage—again, this doesn’t affect damage from spells, but does decrease damage from natural abilities like breath weapons or claws.

When the spell wears off, any hit points gained from being enlarged are lost, although the affected creature can’t be brought to less than1 hp due to this. Any hit points lost from being shrunken return fully when the spell wears off.

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Illusion

**Target:** One nearby creature

### Symbol

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Abjuration

**Effect:** You create a glowing symbol on a nearby object that you imbue with a variable effect from the list below. You can choose between a lesser symbol, which has a weaker effect but affects more targets, or a greater symbol, which has a stronger effect but only affects one target.

Lesser Symbols

_Fear:_ The targets are struck by fear (-4 to attacks and can’t use the escalation die; save ends).

_Hopelessness:_ The targets are struck by hopelessness (-5 to MD and -5 difficulty to skill checks to give suggestions or commands to the target; save ends).

_Pain:_ The target has disadvantage on attacks (save ends).

_Discord:_ The targets are confused until the end of their next turn.

_Persuasion:_ The targets are subject to a suggestion by the caster (save ends). The effect also ends if the target takes damage.

Greater Symbols

_Insanity:_ The target is confused (save ends).

_Sleep:_ The target falls unconscious (save ends). The effect also ends if the target takes damage.

_Stun:_ The target is stunned (save ends).

_Death:_ The target starts making last gasp saves (16+). If it fails the fourth save, it dies.

The symbol lasts until it is activated, or until 24 hours have passed. You also set an activation trigger, for example when the object is touched, when an undead creature comes near it, or when someone passes through the doorway under it.

When the symbol is triggered, it makes the following attack:

**Target (lesser symbol):** the 1d4 closest creatures with 120 hp or fewer

**Target (greater symbol):** the closest creature with 180 hp or fewer

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** As per the chosen symbol

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 9th | Increase the hp threshold to 180 / 270 hp. |

#### Champion Feat

You can hide the symbol, so that it only becomes visible on a certain condition (for example, when an orc approaches within 30 feet, or when someone is touching the object). The symbol must become visible before it can trigger.

#### Epic Feat

The effect skips nearby enemies with more hit points than the hp threshold if eligible targets are within range.

---

### Time Travel

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

**Effect:** You and several allies (the adventuring party, more or less) next to you can travel backwards in time. Your control over this temporal shift is limited—you pick your destination age, and then fight a number of battles equal to the number of ages travelled. Your opponents in these battles may be Eternals. You may take a quick rest between fights, but if you take a full heal-up or a campaign loss when fighting your way back in time, you’ll arrive in an unfamiliar place and time in your destination age. If you endure, you get to pick roughly when and where you’ll arrive.

You can return to your home age by casting this spell again, or you may be dragged back to the present when reality snaps back (i.e. at the end of the adventure.) You don’t usually need to fight your way back to the future on the return trip.

You cannot use this spell to travel into the future (although entities from the future can use it to travel back to the present), or to travel within the same age.

You can only travel back to a specific age once per level. Trying to repeat the same time-jump more than once may have unfortunate consequences.

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 9th | You get to take a full heal-up once during your travel in time. You must describe the weird cross-temporal place where you take a break from battling your way through the howling time winds. |

---

### Transfer Enchantment

_Special:_ You or an ally you are next to must be suffering from a condition caused by an enemy for you to cast this spell.

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** 2d6 x 10 psychic damage, and you can transfer one condition caused by your enemies from you or the ally you are next to over to the target. If timing is required, interpret the transferred condition as if you had caused it with this spell.

**Miss:** Half damage.

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 9th | 2d10 x 10 damage; if the spell misses, you regain it during your next quick rest. |

---

### Wall of Force

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Evocation

**Effect:** You create a transparent wall in a straight line across the battlefield. The wall can be a few hundred feet across. The wall blocks creatures, attacks, and spells.

When damage is dealt directly to the wall, divide the damage of that attack by 10 and roll a d20. If the die roll is lower, the wall dissipates.

| Higher Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 9th | The wall now only dissipates on the third failed roll. |

---

## 9th Level Spells

### Disintegrate

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 4d8 x 10 damage, and the target is vulnerable (hard save ends, 16+).

In addition, if the target drops to 0 hp from this attack, or drops to 0 hp before it saves against the vulnerable effect of this attack, it is gone, dusted, nothing remaining.

**Miss:** Half damage.

#### Epic Feat

You can now target a far away creature with the spell.

---

### Dominate Monster

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Enchantment

**Target:** One nearby creature

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** You take complete control over the target (normal save 11+ ends; double-strength and stronger monsters make an easy save 6+). The target acts on its normal turn, but you determine its actions. If you order the target to do something that goes against its very nature, it can immediately save against the effect.

#### Epic Feat

You can target a group of mooks as a single target.

---

### Feeblemind

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Enchantment

**Target:** One nearby creature

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target is reduced to minimal intelligence and instinctual behavior (hard save 16+ ends). The target can still physically defend itself and fight, and it recognizes friend from foe, but it can’t speak, cast spells, or use any advanced tactics. This is effectively a stronger version of the hampered condition.

**Miss:** The target is dazed until the end of your next turn.

#### Epic Feat

The target can only save against the spell effect when the escalation die is even.

---

### Foresight

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Divination

**Target:** You or a nearby ally

**Effect:** The target rolls two d12s and keeps the higher result. As a free action, it can reduce the die by one to gain a sudden insight about an upcoming task, which grants advantage to a skill check, attack, or save. The target can also reduce the die by one to avoid being surprised, or impose disadvantage on an attack against it. The spell ends when the die is reduced to zero, or at the next full heal-up.

### Magma Golem

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Conjuration

_Special:_ You can only cast this spell outside of battle; it requires 2d4 minutes to cast.

**Effect:** You summon a magma golem to fight as your ally in upcoming battles, according to the summoning rules. The golem stays animated until it is reduced to zero hit points, or until your next full heal-up.

#### Epic Feat

When the magma golem engages an enemy, it deals 25 fire damage to them.

#### Summoned Magma Golem

| Normal 9th level | **Initiative +14; Diamond Fist +17 vs. AC--40 fire damage** | **AC** **PD**| **26** **24** |

### Maze

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Conjuration

**Target:** One nearby creature

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target is removed from the battlefield and teleported to a labyrinth-like demiplane, where it has to search for the exit. At the end of each turn, it makes a normal save (11+). If it succeeds, it immediately rolls another save that turn, otherwise it starts saving again at the end of its next turn. It needs three successes to escape from the maze. Enemies whose MD is higher than yours only need two successes. Minotaurs always succeed at their save against this spell.

**Miss:** —

#### Epic Feat

Enemies now need four successes to escape the maze (three if their MD is higher than yours).

### Meteor Swarm

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

_Special:_ You summon a meteor swarm. If you're underground, you get the ur-dark stalactite equivalent! Nothing more happens this round, but roll 1d3 + 1 to determine how many meteors you have summoned.

At the start of your next turn, even if you are unconscious or dead or have left the area, the meteors arrive one per turn at the start of each of your turns and slam into the combat area.

**Target:** You can make an attack with each meteor against 1d4 enemies in a group. Alternatively, use the spell to level an area with high impact property damage.

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** 4d4 x 10 damage of the energy type of your choice (cold, fire, lightning).

Any allies engaged with the enemies you are targeting take one-fourth damage from each meteor that impacts the area.

**Miss:** Half damage.

#### Epic Feat

Each meteor now deals 5d4 x 10 damage.

### Power Word Kill

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Enchantment

**Target:** One nearby enemy

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** The target takes 100 ongoing necrotic damage. If it rolls a natural 5 or less on its save, increase the ongoing damage by 50.

**Miss:** 50 ongoing damage

#### Epic Feat

On a natural 5 or less on the save, increase the ongoing damage by 100.

---

### Prismatic Barriers

Close-quarters Spell

Full Recovery

**Target:** You

**Effect:** You create a series of stationary multicolored barriers around you that grant you resist 18+ to all damage, even from weapons (but not from radiant or necrotic). You can leave or re-enter the barriers without harming yourself, but other creatures who pass them suffer 4d20 points of a certain damage type as indicated on the chart below. The rainbow barriers can be overcome only by physically passing through them, or by dealing 40 points of a certain damage type to each one in the specific order presented below. Attack rolls that target a barrier must overcome your PD (even if they would normally target AC or MD), and the resistances don’t apply to the barriers—only to you. As each barrier comes down, you lose the indicated resistance type; you also lose your resistance to weapon damage when the final violet barrier is dispersed.

#### Epic Feat

You can expand the barriers to hold 1d2 allies who can enter and exit them just as you can. Any adventurer or champion tier monsters who pass through a barrier must make a hard save (16+) or be hampered and dazed until the end of their next turn.

| Layer-Barrier | Resistance Type and Damage Type | Type Overcome By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st–Red | Fire | Cold |
| 2nd–Orange | Thunder | Thunder |
| 3rd–Yellow | Force | Necrotic |
| 4th–Green | Acid | Psychic |
| 5th–Blue | Cold | Force |
| 6th–Indigo | Lightning | Radiant |
| 7th–Violet | Psychic | Lightning |

### Prismatic Spray

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Evocation

**Target:** One random nearby enemy per point of Intelligence modifier

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. PD

**Hit:** Roll 1d8 to determine which color ray affects the target.

| **d8** | **Color** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Red | The target takes 2d8 x 10 ongoing fire damage. |
| 2 | Orange | The target takes 3d8 x 10 acid damage. |
| 3 | Yellow | The target takes 3d8 x 10 lightning damage. |
| 4 | Green | The target takes 2d8 x 10 ongoing poison damage. If it fails a save while it has 150 hp or fewer, it dies. |
| 5 | Blue | The target takes 3d8 x 10 cold damage. |
| 6 | Indigo | The target is hampered (save ends). After the third failed save, it is permanently turned into stone. |
| 7 | Violet | The target is blinded (treat as weakened, -4 to attacks and defenses). If it fails its save three times, it is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) |
| 8 | | The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8s. |

**Miss:** Roll 1d8 to determine the ray color, but the target takes half damage and ignores any non-damage effect.

### Suppress Magic

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Abjuration

**Effect:** Nearby enemies have disadvantage on magic and spell attacks (anything that can be targeted by Counterspell). If they try to cast a spell that does not involve an attack roll, roll a d20; if the roll is a natural 1–5, the spell fails. The effect lasts until the end of the battle, until you fall unconscious, or until an enemy rolls a natural 20 on a spell attack roll or spell failure check.

---

### Teleport

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

**Effect:** You and up to 4 allies next to you can teleport to any location in the world, underworld, or overworld that you have previously visited.

When you teleport, roll a d20. If you roll a 1, you miss your desired location and arrive somewhere else altogether. Otherwise, you and your allies arrive at the desired location at the start of your next turn.

Any effects of spells or items cast before teleporting are dispelled and no longer function on arrival.

#### Epic Feat

Your allies don't need to be next to you before you cast the spell, just nearby. Alternately, if they are all next to you when you cast the spell, you can teleport to a location known to one of your allies.

---

### Time Stop

Close-quarters Spell

Full Recovery

Transmutation

**Target:** You

**Effect:** Time seems to cease flowing for everyone but you. You speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen to you, although they are still moving at their normal speeds. You can take 1d4+1 full turns (standard action, move action, quick action) as a free action. You suffer effects like ongoing damage normally while taking these turns. While the time stop is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells. You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature’s possession. Any spell with a duration longer than the remaining duration of the time stop has its normal effects on other creatures once the time stop ends.

### Twisted Nightmare

Ranged Spell

Full Recovery

Illusion

**Target:** One nearby enemy with 750 hp or fewer

**Attack:** Intelligence + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target is confused (save ends). It takes a penalty to the save equal to the escalation die. Whenever the target hits its own ally, it takes psychic damage equal to half the damage it dealt. Whenever the target takes damage, increase the damage of its attacks by its level until the end of the battle (even after the spell ends).

**Miss:** You can repeat the attack against the target once during your next turn as a quick action.

#### Epic Feat

If you hit the target with this spell, you gain a +2 bonus to attacks against it until the end of the battle.

---

### Wish

Close-quarters Spell

Full Recovery

Conjuration

**Effect:** You utter the words “I wish …”, and the literal wording of that Wish becomes reality. Wish is the ultimate freeform spell, as it can make anything happen. It can heal wounds, transport you anywhere, summon items, and make bad things happen to your enemies. However, the universe has a way to reflect overly ambitious Wishes back at the caster, by giving them exactly what they wanted.

_Special:_ You cannot, or rather should not attempt to cast this spell more than three times in a lifetime. Stories are vague as to the reason, but the most common legend is that the genie who fulfills your wishes is freed after the third casting, and a fourth attempt will force the caster to take their place.

_GM Note:_ If you are looking for a literary inspiration for this spell, think about Cinderella’s transformation to join the ball. Think about who fulfills wishes in your campaign — Faerie godmothers? Genies? Primus?

All in all, treat this spell as a plot device. Fulfill the Wish in a way that moves the story forward, with an epic effect that is worthy of a 9th level spell, just like you would handle a 5 or 6 on an icon relationship roll. This is the most powerful spell in the game, cast by one of the most powerful casters in the game world, at the peak of the campaign. The results can and should feel amazing. There is always room to introduce unintended negative consequences later.
