## Class Features

Psions use mundane implements, such as foci and beads, to improve their attacks. Unlike wizards and clerics, psions don't choose the affinities they know. Instead, a psion of a given level can access all the affinities in a category that are their level or lower.

The category of affinity you'll cast on your turn is randomly decided, but you get to decide how many of your resources you'll use. You have a limited number of daily and once-per-battle affinities, so each turn you must decide whether to use one of the powerful affinities in the category you're casting from or whether you'll stick with an at-will affinity.

Psions are not allowed to cast rituals.

---

### Psionics

Psionics has three main categories of affinities: attack, defense, and iconic.

You have a pool of 6 options, represented by a die. You can allocate Attack, Defense, and Iconic options equally between the numbers on a die. When you roll a number, you gain the associated affinity and you can't roll the number again until you have rolled all options numbers on the die. When you have exhausted every number, you reset.

If you would gain another affinity, you add that to your pool of options and increase the size of the die you would roll.

If you roll…

- **Attack:** The next psion affinity you cast during the battle must be an attack affinity, but you won't have to choose the affinity until your turn.
- **Defense:** The next psion affinity you cast during the battle must be a defense affinity, but you won't have to choose the affinity until your turn.
- **Iconic:** The next psion affinity you cast during the battle must be an iconic affinity. Immediately roll a die to determine which relationship's affinities you'll have to choose from. For example, if your character has 3 relationships, assign a number to each relationship and roll a d3. You don't have to choose the specific affinity until your turn.

Whether you cast an at-will, per-battle, or daily affinity, you cast it at the affinity level shown on the affinity progression table.

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per day when you cast an iconic daily or once-per-battle affinity from an relationship you have at least a one-point with, roll a normal save. If you succeed, you don't expend that affinity, allowing you to cast it again, or another daily/once-per-battle affinity.

#### Champion Feat

Once per day when you draw an iconic affinity, before rolling, choose an relationship you have at least a one-point with. The affinity you cast next will be from that relationship.

#### Epic Feat

You can use the champion feat power a second time, but only if you choose a relationship that you have at least a two points with.

---

### High Weirdness

Psions usually display an uncanny weirdness that presents itself through their affinities, and sometimes even bleeds through to their general demeanor. This weirdness is represented in game mechanics through the High Weirdness table below.

When an enemy scores a critical hit against you, roll high weirdness and consult the table to see what effect applies. You can use a standard action to change it. Unless otherwise specified, the high weirdness effects last until the end of the battle.

Unless otherwise specified, the high weirdness effects last until the end of the battle.

#### Adventurer Feat

If you have one or more Warp talents, whenever you make a d6 roll for one, also roll for a new high weirdness effect. The new effect replaces the weirdness effect currently active, if any.

If you have no Warp talents, roll for a new high weirdness effect whenever you draw an iconic affinity.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle when you roll for a high weirdness effect, roll twice and use both results. Reroll duplicate results.

#### Epic Feat

One battle per day, each time you roll for a high weirdness effect, roll twice and use both results. Reroll duplicate results.

#### High Weirdness Table

| **d100** | **High Weirdness Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| **1–2** | You accidentally summon 1d3 wibbles that either attack you or drift off to wreak a small amount of havoc elsewhere in the battle. |
| **3–4** | You're hit by a pulsing wrinkle in time. You move and speak ever–so–slightly slower than you should until you catch up. There's no effect this turn, but at the end of your turn, decrease your initiative 2d6 points, to a minimum of 1. |
| **5–6** | Each creature in the battle with temporary hit points loses half of them. |
| **7–8** | You can only speak by asking questions. If you or your character violates this requirement, your character takes 1 damage the first time, 2 damage the second time, and so on. (Have another player keep track.) |
| **9–10** | Your magic items' quirks take over. If you aren't doing a good enough job of roleplaying this personality fiasco, the GM and the rest of the players are authorized to suggest (in)appropriate behavior. |
| **11** | You leech personality traits from surrounding spirits, whatever those happen to be. These are only traits, not personality overrides. |
| **12** | You must speak in what you think could be the voice of the last creature your psion attacked. If it doesn't seem to have a voice, invent one. |
| **13** | Small squeaking rodents erupt from any plausible cover that you go near. There's no real effect except they're somewhat noisy and rodents suddenly pop up in unexpected places. |
| **14** | Your (the PC) favorite song begins playing around you magically, getting louder and louder (tell the table what type of song it is, or maybe hum it). It might or might not interfere with bardic songs or monsters that need to be heard properly to get their dirty work done. |
| **15** | A disembodied voice begins narrating the events of the battle to all participants. The voice isn't necessarily on your side, pick a random relationship it seems to be associated with. |
| **16** | You grow horns or other spikes all over. If you already have horns, then you lose them. Some of the horns, or lack thereof, persist after the weirdness ends. |
| **17** | One of your arms becomes a functional tentacle. It has no mechanical effects, but unless you're special or lucky it's probably not a very pretty tentacle. Your option on whether or not it remains after the weirdness ends. |
| **18** | A great gust of wind circles around the battlefield. It probably has no serious effect unless there's something happening that a great gust of wind could seriously affect. |
| **19** | All creatures leave colored trails behind them as they move, turning the battle scene into a strange glowing artwork. Images fade every ten seconds or so. |
| **20** | Some minor detail of your appearance changes hair color, gaps between teeth, handedness, and so on. The change is permanent–ish. |
| **21–22** | Grit, explosive dust, or other debris explodes into the air around you, dealing 1d4 damage per tier to each nearby creature. |
| **23–24** | There's tension in the air, or the rumble of distant thunder, or a sense of impending disaster, and the next creature that misses with an attack this battle takes damage equal your Charisma modifier (double your Charisma modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level). |
| **25–26** | Quickly passing auras blur and shake across the battlefield, or cold winds whip through and grow warmer as they pass, or the lights flicker . . . and the creature that has taken the most damage in the battle gains temporary hit points equal to 10% of its maximum hit points. |
| **27–28** | One random creature in the battle other than you teleports next to and is engaged by one of its random enemies other than you. |
| **29–30** | (Global effect) Space seriously twists, affecting the affinities and ranged attacks of each creature in the battle creatures that are nearby count as if they were far away, and creatures that are far away count as if they are nearby. |
| **31–32** | The first affinity you cast this battle has effects (not damage) like an affinity two levels higher than it, if possible. |
| **33–34** | (Global effect) All normal saves made by creatures in the battle are actually easy saves (6+). |
| **35–36** | (Global effect) There's a blurring at the edge of all things. No creature can intercept another. Disengage attempts automatically succeed. |
| **37–38** | (Global effect) The champions shall inherit the dirt! Until the end of your next turn, saves that fail count as if they succeed, and saves that succeed count as if they fail! |
| **39–40** | Roll the escalation die and use the new result. |
| **41–42** | (Global effect) Each creature in the battle taking ongoing damage immediately takes that damage. Then all ongoing damage effects end. |
| **43–44** | (Global effect) Each creature that makes an attack targeting PD targets MD instead. Attacks against MD target PD instead. |
| **45–46** | Your shadow detaches and flits around you. Until the weirdness ends, you gain a +2 attack bonus but take a –2 penalty to saves. Your personality may or may not be affected. It's up to you. |
| **47–48** | Choose yourself or one ally with temporary hit points and double those temporary hit points. |
| **49–50** | There's a large magical special effect of your choice (non-mechanical), and each creature in the battle ignores all resistances. |
| **51–55** | You gain an additional quick action during each of your turns while this weirdness is in effect. |
| **56–60** | When one of your allies casts an psionic affinity this battle, the affinity gains a small bonus effect chosen by the GM (something that suits the affinity and the story). |
| **61–65** | You and your allies gain small halos, or celestial light pours in, or a subtle glow illuminates each countenance. When one of your allies casts a divine affinity this battle, it gains a small bonus effect chosen by the GM, something that suits the affinity and the story. |
| **66–70** | Your features shift and settle into a temporary new pattern. You gain a random species ability until the end of your next turn. Ignore results that duplicate a species ability you already have. Roll a d8. 1: dwarf's that's your best shot; 2: dark elf's cruel; 3: high elf's highblood teleport; 4: gnome's confounding; 5: half–elf's surprising; 6: halfling's evasive; 7: holy one's halo; 8: Tieflings's curse of chaos. |
| **71–75** | If one of your allies is at 0 hit points or below, that ally can roll a free death save that won't count against their missed death save total. |
| **76–80** | Choose one creature (including you) that has already rallied this battle. It can rally again this battle (using the same action it normally would) as if it hadn't already rallied (no roll if the first use). |
| **81–85** | Your presence blurs through space, spirit, and time, and you can fight in spirit on your turn (see [Combat Rules, Special Action](../General-Rules/Combat.md#special-actions)) in addition to taking your normal turn. |
| **86–90** | You shift, you waver, or you go transparent. You don't take any miss damage while this weirdness is affecting you. |
| **91–95** | The magic items in the area all start talking at once. You or one ally of your choice can roll to recharge one magic item (affected creature's choice). |
| **96–97** | Something related to your one unique thing goes very right for you. This is on you and the GM to work out together. The GM has the final say, though. |
| **98** | If you and your allies flee RIGHT NOW, you don't take a campaign loss for your discretion. This may take some explaining. It's all about the psionics. |
| **99** | Roll twice more on this table. If you wish you can ignore one of the rolled results but must stick with the other. If you roll the same result twice, you get that weirdness just once. |
| **100** | You gain an extra standard action during the next turn after this weirdness goes into effect. |

## Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

### Warp Talents

There are three separate Warp talents that you may choose from. They provide random powers or features that surface unpredictably during battles (and perhaps during non-combat moments of high tension).

If a warp talent gives you access to a affinity from another class, associate it with psionic's attack category or defense category. You can then cast it if that affinity type comes up for you.

#### Attacking Warp

Psionics provides you with a random warp effect when the next affinity you cast will be an attack affinity. This talent works best for psions with a high Dexterity.

When your random affinity choice indicates an attack affinity, roll a d6 to determine the effect you'll gain from the elemental warp. Even though you can't cast the affinity until your next turn, the warp effect applies now.

| **d6** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | _Air_: You gain _flight_ until the end of your next turn. |
| **2** | _Earth:_ Until the end of your next turn, each enemy that misses you with a melee attack is stuck until the end of its next turn. |
| **3** | _Fire_: Until the end of your next turn, you can pop free from staggered enemies as a quick action. |
| **4** | _Water_: You gain a bonus to disengage checks until the end of your next turn equal to your Dexterity modifier |
| **5** | _Metal_: Until the end of your next turn, when an enemy disengages from you, it takes damage equal to your Dexterity modifier (double your Dexterity modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level). |
| **6** | _Void:_ During your next turn, you can use a move action to teleport to a nearby location you can see. |

##### Adventurer Feat

When you roll a successful disengage check, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Dexterity modifier (double your Dexterity modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

##### Champion Feat

While you are flying due to any effect, you gain a bonus to disengage checks equal to your Dexterity modifier.

##### Epic Feat

When one of your affinities or powers lets you teleport to a nearby location, you can instead teleport to a far away location you can see.

---

#### Defensive Warp

Psionics provides you with a random warp effect when the next affinity you cast will be a defense affinity. This talent works best for psions with a high Wisdom.

When your random affinity choice indicates a defense affinity, roll a d6 to determine the effect you'll gain from the elemental warp. Even though you can't cast the affinity until your next turn, the warp effect applies now.

| **d6** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | _Air_: Once before the end of your next turn, you can heal using a recovery as a quick action. |
| **2** | _Earth:_ You gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level). |
| **3** | _Fire_: Until the end of your next turn, when an enemy moves to engage you, it takes fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level). |
| **4** | _Water_: Until the end of your next turn, when you heal using a recovery, add hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier to that healing (double your Wisdom modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level). |
| **5** | _Metal_: Until the end of your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. |
| **6** | _Void:_ Until the end of your next turn, the first time an attack hits you, as a free action you can choose to lose hit points equal to your level to force the attacker to reroll the attack. |

##### Adventurer Feat

When you heal using a recovery, add hit points equal to the escalation die to that healing.

##### Champion Feat

While you are at maximum hit points, you gain a +1 bonus to all defenses.

##### Epic Feat

When an attacker rerolls an attack against you, it takes an attack penalty equal to your Wisdom modifier.

---

#### Iconic Warp

Psionics provides you with a random warp effect when the next affinity you cast will be an iconic affinity. This talent works best for psions with a high Intelligence.

When your random affinity choice indicates an iconic affinity, roll a d6 to determine the effect you'll gain from the elemental warp. Even though you can't cast the affinity until your next turn, the warp effect applies now.

| **d6** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | _Air_: Randomly determine two relationship associations for the affinity you'll cast instead of one. Choose one of those associations to use for that affinity. |
| **2** | _Earth:_ Until the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to PD and MD equal to your Intelligence modifier. |
| **3** | _Fire_: Until the end of your next turn, you gain the once-per-battle species power of a random nearby ally; ignore this benefit if it duplicates your own species power or if it doesn't make sense during the battle (human, for example). |
| **4** | _Water_:Until the end of your next turn, you gain a bonus to saves equal to your Intelligence modifier. |
| **5** | _Metal_: Until the end of your next turn, critical hits scored against you only count as normal hits. |
| **6** | _Void:_ When you roll a natural 20 with an attack, the critical hit range of your attacks expands by 2 until the end of the battle (cumulative). |

##### Adventurer Feat

Once per battle when you roll for an iconic warp effect, roll the d6 twice and choose the result you want.

##### Champion Feat

When you roll a natural 18–20 on a save, a nearby ally of your choice can roll a save against a save ends effect.

##### Epic Feat

When you roll a natural 20 with an attack, the critical hit range of your attacks expands by 2 until the end of the battle (cumulative)."

---

### Blip of Bard

You gain 1 affinity of Bard. Whenever you take a full heal-up, randomly choose a bard spell or song up to the highest level you can cast. For the rest of the day, you know this affinity and can cast it according to its normal usage pattern—at-will, once per battle, recharge, or daily—when that option is rolled during your psion affinity casting sequence.

#### Adventurer Feat

After each full heal-up, choose an art form such as kazoo improvisation, ice carving or gnome pantomime. Roll a d6 and gain as many points in a related background. The inspiration lasts until the next full heal-up, at which point a new inspiration strikes.

#### Champion Feat

After each full heal-up, choose one random battle cry from the bard list. You can use this battle cry with your chaos mage melee attacks. Once per day, you can also trigger it with an at-will affinity attack roll.

#### Epic Feat

If you don’t like either the random bard affinity or the battle cry you rolled for the day, roll again. You’re stuck with the second one.

---

### Eidolon of Anarchy

As a rampant psionic vessel, your body isn’t stable. The color of your hair, eyes and even skin keeps shifting through all the colors of the rainbow, based on your mood, the weather, and the whims of psionics. On some days, you wake up as a different species or gender. All of this is wildly confusing to others, but you were born with it and know this is who you are. When you manifest a affinity, it’s less of a conscious act of casting than a failure to contain the psionics.

Since psionics are a manifestation of your physical being, you use Constitution instead of Charisma for all Psion affinities.

As a side effect, your body and mind shake off attempts to reshape them more easily. You can roll saves at the start of your turn instead of at the end of your turn. A successful save against ongoing damage, for example, means that you will not take the ongoing damage that turn.

#### Adventurer Feat

Reroll natural 1s when spending a recovery to heal.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, when you are out of daily affinities, you can cast a daily affinity by expending a recovery without healing instead.

#### Epic Feat

When you save against a save ends effect with a natural even success, make a Constitution + level vs. PD attack against a random nearby enemy. If you hit, that target is now under the effect you just shook off.

---

### Enigmatic Pet

You have befriended a small creature, like a cat or a fox, which hangs around you to get petted and fed. It seems completely oblivious to the chaos and mayhem that surrounds you, and ignores any High Weirdness effects. You have a nagging feeling that the universe has sent it to counterbalance the effects of your powers.

Once per day, your pet can cancel an ongoing magical or supernatural effect. That effect can be a condition on a creature, an item effect, something in the environment, or your own High Weirdness. If the effect is permanent, such as an item enchantment, roll a save each turn to see when the effect is reactivated.

Your pet won’t join you in a fight, and it can’t be targeted by affinities or attacks.

Also choose one ability for your pet from the list below:

- _Axiomatic_: Once per day, when making a d20-based check, your pet can set the roll to 13 instead of rolling.
- _Detector_: It can smell magic by scent.
- _Flight_: It can fly.
- _Healer_: Once per day, it can grant someone the use of a recovery to heal by touch.
- _Innate Magic_: Your pet knows three Wizard cantrips, and it can use one cantrip per scene.
- _Mundane Aura_: It appears fully natural and resists any divination magic cast on it.
- _Negator_: It can use its anti-magic ability twice per day.
- _Shapechanger_: It can take any shape it likes, as long as it stays roughly cat-sized.
- _Shield_: Once per day, it can force an enemy to reroll an attack against you with a d12.
- _Shy_: It can turn invisible at-will.
- _Talkative_: Your pet can talk. Each session, determine its personality with the Personality table

| d6 | Personality |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Cutesy |
| 2 | Zen-like |
| 3 | Condescending |
| 4 | Sneaky |
| 5 | Hungry |
| 6 | Cuddly |

#### Adventurer Feat

Your pet has a second ability from the list.

#### Champion Feat

Your pet has a third ability.

#### Epic Feat

Your pet has a fourth ability.

---

### Master of Mayhem

You gain a bonus daily affinity, for a total of three at 1st level.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, roll twice for affinity. Keep one to determine your affinity and mark both as used.

#### Epic Feat

When you have no psion daily affinities left, regain one when you take a quick rest.

---

### Mind Reader

You can read the thoughts of nearby sentient creatures. If they are unaware of your mind reading ability you can make an 11+ save to understand their thoughts.

If you are in battle you can use a quick action to attempt to reveal the thoughts and strategy of one creature nearby of you, make an 11+ save to understand their thoughts with a penalty equal to their intelligence modifier unless they are aware of your ability to understand their thoughts, then make a 16+ save instead. If you succeed you gain advantage on the next attack roll against that creature.

If you do not speak their language make the save with disadvantage.

#### Adventurer Feat

If you do not speak their language you do not make the save with disadvantage.

#### Champion Feat

The save is 6+, 11+ if they are aware of your mind reader ability.

---

### Psionic Warrior

You don’t take an attack penalty when wielding a one-handed melee weapon of any kind, or a shield. You also take no attack penalty for wearing heavy armor, and your base AC in heavy armor is increased to 12.

When you would roll to determine your next affinity, you can choose to gain the effects below instead of an affinity. The effect depends on the affinity you roll, and it lasts until the end of your next turn.

| **Affinity** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| Attack | Your melee attacks deal fire damage, and you deal 1d6 extra damage per level on a hit. |
| Defense | If an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can make a melee attack against them as an interrupt action. |
| Iconic / Blood | Gain advantage on your next melee attack roll. |
| Iconic / Light | Your melee attacks deal holy damage, you deal half damage on a miss. |
| Iconic / Twisted | Your melee attacks deal negative energy damage, and if you hit, the target takes a 1d6 penalty to all defenses until the end of your next turn. |

If you have a warp talent, you still get the talent’s effect even if you drop the affinity.

_Special_: If you are a hybrid psion, the psion side counts as a “skilled warrior” and no longer reduces your WEAPON damage die. However, you have one fewer psion daily affinity.

---

#### Adventurer Feat

Your recoveries use exploding dice (add one more die for each that comes up as maximum).

---

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, when the escalation die is 3+, make a melee attack as a quick action after using a psion affinity on that turn.

### Separate Existence

You are ever-so-slightly detached from normal physical reality. Play the story side of that as you like; the game mechanics side is that you can cast ranged affinities while engaged with enemies without taking opportunity attacks.

#### Champion Feat

When you teleport, you can heal using a recovery.

For the rest of the day, you know this necromancer affinity and can cast it according to its normal usage pattern—at-will, once per battle, recharge, or daily—when that option is rolled during your turn.

If the necromancer affinity refers to Intelligence, you can replace that ability score with references to Charisma.

#### Adventurer Feat

One battle per day, you can gain the Cackling Soliloquist talent from the necromancer class.

#### Champion Feat

While you have an _earth_ or _metal_ warp effect active, when an enemy in the battle drops to 0 hp, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (double your Charisma modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

#### Epic Feat

If you don't like the first random necromancer affinity you select for the day, you can determine another random necromancer affinity. You're stuck with the second one.

---

### Touch of Wizardry

You gain 1 affinity of Wizard. Whenever you take a full heal-up, randomly choose a wizard spell of the highest level you can cast. For the rest of the day, you know this wizard affinity and can cast it according to its normal usage pattern—at-will, cyclic, once per battle, recharge, or daily—when that option is rolled during your turn.

If the wizard affinity refers to Intelligence, you can replace that ability score with references to Charisma.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain a random wizard talent at the start of each day. Roll a d3. 1: Abjuration; 2: Evocation; 3: High Arcana (_counter magic_). Replace references to "wizard" in these talents with "psion" and Intelligence with Charisma.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a single daily use of the wizard's _utility affinity_, cast at your level or lower.

#### Epic Feat

If you don't like the first random wizard affinity you select for the day, you can determine another random wizard affinity. You're stuck with the second one.

### Trace of the Divine

For the rest of the day, you know this cleric affinity and can cast it according to its normal usage pattern—at-will, once per battle, recharge, or daily—when that option is rolled during your turn.

If the cleric affinity refers to Wisdom, you can replace that ability score with references to Charisma.

#### Adventurer Feat

At the start of the day, choose a random cleric invocation, excepting those from the healing domain. You can use that invocation as if you were a cleric once this day as a quick action.

#### Champion Feat

While you have an _air_ or _water_ warp effect active, when you heal using a recovery or cast an affinity that lets an ally heal using a recovery, add an extra recovery die to the healing.

#### Epic Feat

In addition to the random invocation you gain at the start of the day, you also get the talent/domain powers that go with it.

---

### Unleashed Pain

While you are staggered, increase the damage dice of your psion affinities by one step (d4 to d6 and so on).

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per battle, when rolling an affinity, you can swap the affinity for an iconic affinity that has already been used. You can only do this if you have a used iconic affinity.

#### Champion Feat

While you are staggered, your psion affinities gain a +2 bonus to their critical threat range.

#### Epic Feat

While you are staggered, all damage dice of your affinities are exploding dice (when you roll the maximum number, roll another die and add it).

---

### Whiff of Sorcery

You gain 1 affinity of Sorcery. Whenever you take a full heal-up, randomly choose a sorcerer spell of the highest level you can cast. For the rest of the day, you know this sorcerer affinity and can cast it according to its normal usage pattern—at-will, once per battle, recharge, or daily—when that option is rolled during your turn.

#### Adventurer Feat

Twice per day, you can gather power as if you were a sorcerer in order to deal double damage with either a sorcerer affinity or a psion affinity the next time you cast an affinity. You also gain the chaotic benefit for gathering power. (Note that you should have already determined the type of affinity you will be casting, since you select an affinity type when you roll initiative and at the end of each turn, so you're generally better off waiting to gather power when you know you have an attack or iconic affinity coming.)

#### Champion Feat

While you have an _air_ or _fire_ warp effect active, add fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier to your miss damage (double your Charisma modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).

#### Epic Feat

If you don't like the first random sorcerer affinity you select for the day, you can determine another random sorcerer affinity. You're stuck with the second one.

#### Unsummoning (7th level+)

Ranged affinity

Daily

**Target:** One nearby non-undead enemy that the GM hasn't given a proper name, or that doesn't play a key role in the current storyline

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** The target is sent elsewhere, possibly to a location that's close enough for the PCs to have to deal with it in a subsequent battle. It might also go somewhere "interesting."

Replace the target with the GM's choice of an undamaged and hostile undead creature that is one level lower than the original target. If the target was a large or double-strength creature, the replacement must be large or double-strength, or perhaps two normal undead instead of one show up. Ditto for huge/triple-strength targets. Therefore you're only slightly reducing the raw power of the opposition; the advantage of using the affinity is that you're getting rid of an enemy you match up badly against and dropping the level of the opposition by one. The disadvantage, of course, is that you'll probably have to face that enemy again.

**Miss:** 7d10 + Charisma psychic damage.

| Higher Level | Effect |
