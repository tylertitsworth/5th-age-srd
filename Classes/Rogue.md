## Class Features

All rogues fight better when they gain momentum, are good at stabbing enemies in the back, and have a knack for avoiding the traps that their clueless allies would stumble into.

### Momentum

Many of the rogue's powers function only when the rogue has momentum.

You gain momentum by hitting an enemy with an attack.

You lose momentum when you are hit by an attack.

The default is that you can use momentum powers without losing momentum, but a few powers specify that you must spend your momentum to use them. You don't have to use attacks that require momentum against the foe you hit to gain that momentum.

Momentum powers that do not require you to spend your momentum are generally classified as interrupt actions. You can only use one interrupt action a round, which keeps your momentum powers from dominating the battle.

---

### Sneak Attack

Once per round when you make a rogue melee weapon attack against an enemy engaged with one or more of your allies, you can deal extra damage if your attack hits.

| **Rogue Level** | **Extra Damage** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | +1d4 |
| **2** | +1d6 |
| **4** | +2d6 |
| **6** | +3d6 |
| **8** | +5d6 |
| **10** | +7d6 |

#### Adventurer Feat

Your Sneak Attack feature also works the first round of combat against enemies with a lower initiative than you.

#### Champion Feat

Your Sneak Attack feature also works against enemies who are confused, dazed, stunned, vulnerable to your attack, or weakened.

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle when you miss with an attack that would have allowed you to deal Sneak Attack damage, replace the normal miss damage with your full Sneak Attack damage.

---

### Trap Sense

Even rogues whose backgrounds don't have anything to do with noticing, avoiding, or disarming traps have a unique knack for dealing with traps.

If a rogue's skill check involving a trap is a natural even failure, the rogue can reroll the skill check once. If a trap's attack roll against a rogue is a natural odd roll, the rogue can force the trap to reroll the attack once.

#### Adventurer Feat

The trap attack reroll can also apply to a nearby ally of the rogue as the rogue shouts a warning or acts to prevent the trap from hitting.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a +3 bonus to skill check rerolls you make against traps.

#### Epic Feat

You only take half damage from trap attacks.

---

## Class Talents

Choose three of the following class talents.

### An Offer You Can't Refuse

In a situation using social skills where violence is a potential outcome (such as a back alley negotiation or an argument over treasure), get a +3 bonus on the relevant social skill check. If you fail, all enemies attacking you get a +3 bonus to all attacks in the first round of combat.

---

### Arcane Trickster

You gain a bard, sorcerer, or wizard spell as a bonus power. If it’s a melee attack spell, you can sneak attack with it. Starting from 3rd level, you can replace a rogue power with a spell from the same class, at two levels lower.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain three cantrips from the wizard list, which you can cast like a wizard.

#### Champion Feat

You can use a melee weapon as an arcane implement for the spell. If you choose a ranged spell, you no longer provoke opportunity attacks with it.

#### Epic Feat

When you are missed by a spell or magical effect, make a hard save (16+). If you succeed, you can use this spell yourself once during the same scene or battle. Use your Charisma modifier for any attack rolls with it.

---

### Artifact Fence

Buying and selling magic items is a risky business—not just because they are often stolen or outright illegal, but also because it takes a strong-willed individual to carry around that much magical paraphernalia without flat-out going insane. Your prior experience with fencing magical goods allows you to carry and use a number of magic items equal to your level + 1 without suffering item quirks.

_Special:_ If you also take the Thievery talent, you may begin play with one Adventurer-tier magic item which you could normally use (although your specific choice of item is subject to GM approval). This item was stolen, either by you or by whoever gave or sold it to you; whether you’re aware of this information or not is your choice to make. As a result, you also begin play with an additional 1-point negative relationship associated with the person from whom the item was stolen, and you can only receive complicated advantages from that relationship.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you activate a rune to enhance an item, you can roll twice for the random enhancement effect and apply your choice of the two.

#### Champion Feat

If, while using a number of magic items less than your level + 1, you choose to act upon a magic item’s quirks to the detriment of yourself or your fellow adventurers (or both!), you can improve the benefit granted by that item by 1 tier of efficacy for the duration of your next combat. The GM has final say on what constitutes detrimental, but generally speaking it should be something that makes them chuckle evilly.

#### Epic Feat

When using a number of magic items above the limit of your level + 1, you can ignore quirks from item pairs with fundamentally opposing personalities

---

### Babyface

Whenever you try to play innocent or get away with something, you can reroll a natural even failure on the skill check once. On the other hand, if you try to appear dangerous or intimidate people, you have disadvantage, as people just don‘t take you seriously enough (unless you do something extremely drastic or violent).

#### Adventurer Feat

Your knack with people borders on the supernatural. You gain the Charm Person spell as a bonus power. (You can choose either the bard or the wizard version)

#### Champion Feat

You no longer have disadvantage to intimidate.

#### Epic Feat

You have mastered the switch from innocent to scary. Once per full recovery, you can create a fear aura like a monster of your level, for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier.

---

### Black Rose Agent

You gain a spell from the necromancer list. You can use Charisma instead of Intelligence for attack and damage with the spell, and you can use a melee weapon as an implement.

#### Adventurer Feat

If an ally is engaged with the target, you can Sneak Attack with the spell. If you choose a ranged spell, you no longer provoke opportunity attacks with it.

#### Champion Feat

You can switch out a rogue power to gain an additional necromancer spell, at a -2 level penalty.

---

### Catch Them Unprepared

In the first round of a battle, your attacks have advantage against any opponent that has not acted yet in the initiative order. If there is an ambush or surprise, the surprise round is considered the first round of combat for this talent.

#### Adventurer Feat

Gain a free move action in the first round of battle.

#### Champion Feat

If both attack rolls hit, the attack is a critical hit.

#### Epic Feat

In the first round of combat, your attacks have advantage, even if the target has acted already.

---

### Clear the Decks

Whenever you have momentum, gain +1 AC equal to the number of engaged enemy combatants −1. Bonus applies only to attacks from engaged melee enemies.

#### Adventurer Feat

Bonus now also applies to attacks from engaged ranged enemies.

#### Champion Feat

You now also gain +1 PD equal to the number of engaged enemy combatants −1.

#### Epic Feat

You now also gain +1 MD equal to the number of engaged enemy combatants –1.

---

### Cunning

You can use your Intelligence in place of your Charisma for any rogue attacks, talents, or powers that use Charisma (e.g. _shadow walk_ and _slick feint_). You also gain two extra skill points to spend on intelligence skills and gain a +2 bonus to skill checks involving traps.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +1 bonus to Mental Defense.

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, reroll a save against an effect from an attack that originally hit your Mental Defense.

#### Epic Feat

Your once-per-battle save reroll is now once per save.

---

### Espionage

You have a 5-point skill in spying. Activities covered by this skill include: disguise, double talk, mimicking languages, the art of seduction.

#### Champion Feat

Regardless of level, you gain harmless misdirection as a bonus power in addition to your normal number of powers.

#### Epic Feat

Your Harmless Misdirection now prevents the enemy from attacking you during its next round, whether there’s an engaged ally or not.

---

### Friendly Fire

Enemy melee attacks that fumble trigger rerolls against the attacker’s engaged allies.

#### Adventurer Feat

Enemies on ranged attacks trigger the “shooting into melee” reroll on misses, not the fumbles.

#### Champion Feat

Once per full recovery, the reroll automatically hits the enemy.

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle, reroll automatically hits the enemy.

---

### Improved Evasion

You take no damage or effects from missed attacks against your AC and PD.

#### Adventurer Feat

Enemies cannot gain advantage on attack rolls against you, or roll more than one die and take the better result.

#### Champion Feat

Enemies cannot benefit from increased critical threat range against you. They can only score a critical hit on a natural 20.

#### Epic Feat

When you are hit by an attack against AC or PD that also targets other creatures than you, you take half damage.

---

### Improved Sneak Attack

Your Sneak Attack damage is better than other rogues. Use the following Sneak Attack bonus damage progression instead.

| **Rogue Level** | **Extra Damage** |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | +1d6 |
| **2** | +1d7 |
| **4** | +2d8 |
| **6** | +3d8 |
| **8** | +5d8 |
| **10** | +7d8 |

#### Adventurer Feat

Once per full recovery as a free action, you can add your Sneak Attack damage to any hit against one target that would not otherwise have qualified for the damage.

#### Champion Feat

Once per full recovery, roll d20s for your Sneak Attack damage instead of d8s.

#### Epic Feat

One battle per full recovery, ignore the limitation that you can use Sneak Attack damage only once per round.

---

### Intrusion Expert

You have an uncanny ability to get where you are not supposed to be. Once per full recovery, you can slip, sneak, bumble, or bamboozle your way into a forbidden place such as a treasure vault, a cloister or an invitation-only festival. (If the GM decides that getting to the goal is especially difficult, they can rule this will cost a recovery, to represent exhaustion or small injuries.) If you used this talent to get into a place, you can generally also get out again, but it doesn’t help you get out of a place when you are confined. It’s for intrusion, not escape.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can reroll a natural even failure on a skill check once, when it involves unlocking doors, climbing walls of a built structure, or sneaking around inside buildings.

#### Champion Feat

Subconsciously, you are always looking for an entry and exit point. If you have visited a place once, you can recall details such as guard placements, unsecured doors, climbable walls, and so on. You can reroll a natural even failure once on skill checks to remember such details about a location.

#### Epic Feat

Your keen sense for architecture can tell you immediately where to find what in a building, even if you enter it for the first time, and even against attempts to hide or obfuscate features such as hidden stairs or wall safes.

---

### Knife Thrower

Increase your damage dice with small thrown weapons to d8. You can use your Sneak Attack class feature with thrown weapon attacks, as long as the target is nearby and engaged with an ally.

You also gain 3 skill points towards a skill in knife-throwing and knife-juggling performance arts.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can use any melee attack rogue power as a thrown weapon ranged attack, as long as it could logically work. For example, you could use Thief‘s Strike with a thrown dagger, but you wouldn't be able to grab an item with it, when not engaged, only let if fall on the floor.

#### Champion Feat

When using a small thrown weapon, you can reroll a natural 2 on the attack roll.

#### Epic Feat

Once per battle, when the escalation die is 3+, make a ranged basic attack with a thrown weapon as a quick action. The attack uses a d4 as the damage die.

---

### Murderous

Against staggered enemies, your crit range with rogue attacks expands by 2.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain a +2 attack bonus against staggered enemies.

#### Champion Feat

Your crit range against staggered enemies expands by 2 (now +4).

#### Epic Feat

Whenever a staggered enemy misses you with a melee attack, it's vulnerable to your attacks for the rest of the battle.

---

### Patient Assassin

You can study a target over an extended period of time to spot its weaknesses. Each hour you spend observing the target, you gain a +1 bonus to skill checks against it, up to a maximum of +3. You can build up a bonus against one target per level. If you study more targets than that, you lose the bonus against the target where the longest time passed since you studied it.

#### Adventurer Feat

In a battle against a target you studied, you gain the bonus to initiative and to the critical threat range of attacks against it.

#### Champion Feat

You now gain the bonus for each 10 minutes spent studying the target.

#### Epic Feat

If you manage to surprise the target at the start of a battle, and you are the one chosen to start the ambush, set the escalation die to 1.

---

### Poison Master

You gain the venomous strike bonus power. You also gain a +2 bonus to saves against ongoing poison damage.

#### Venomous Strike

Melee Attack

At-Will

**Target:** One enemy who is not suffering ongoing poison damage.

**Attack:** Dexterity + level vs AC

**Hit:** WEAPON + Dexterity damage.

_Natural Even Hit:_ The target takes ongoing poison damage equal to your Constitution modifier (save ends), ongoing poison damage is now double your Constitution modifier at champion tier, and triple at epic tier.

_Miss:_ Damage equal to your level.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can spend your momentum to use this attack against a creature that is already suffering ongoing poison damage. If you do so, you inflict ongoing poison damage on a successful hit, regardless of whether it’s odd or even.

##### Champion Feat

If an enemy you’re engaged makes a successful saving throw against your ongoing damage, you may spend your momentum to make a venomous strike attack as an interrupt action.

---

### Ready to Roll

You start each battle with momentum.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you are hit by an attack, you retain your momentum if the enemy‘s attack roll was a natural 12 or less.

#### Champion Feat

You no longer lose your momentum when you are hit by an attack.

#### Epic Feat

You gain momentum when you rally.

---

### Scout Ahead

When you move in front in the party marching order or start scouting ahead, roll a d6 exploration die and keep the result. When making a skill check to interact with the environment, such as when determining directions or searching for traps, you may add the exploration die. You can also add the die to a defense against attacks outside of combat, such as a trap or a surprise attack. After you use the bonus, reduce it by one, until it reaches zero. You regain the die after the next quick rest.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you add the die to a perception check (a Wisdom-based skill check), don’t reduce it.

#### Champion Feat

Roll two d6 for your exploration die and keep the higher one.

#### Epic Feat

If you have an exploration die when combat starts, add it to your first attack roll.

---

### Second Identity

You have several other identities that you have cultivated over the years, to the point that you might be better known under your cover name than your real name. Create one such persona per point of Charisma modifier and specify for each one in which circles the persona is known.

Like the Trap Sense class feature, you can reroll a natural even failure on a skill check once when creating a disguise or lying about your identity. Since it takes a con man to spot one, you can also reroll a natural even failure on skill checks to notice other people in disguise, or lying about their identity. This includes disguises created by magic, such as the Disguise Self spell, and innate powers such as from a doppelgänger.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain a 2-point skill for each of your created personas, which represents knowledge and skill sets that you gained when playing that role.

#### Champion Feat

You gain a bonus relationship, and you can decide for each relationship whether it refers to your real self or the persona you have created.

#### Epic Feat

Your ability to spot fake identities has evolved to a supernatural level. You have the equivalent of True Sight for spotting illusions.

---

### Shadow Adept

Once per battle or scene, you can use an expended power with the Shadow keyword a second time. If you choose a full recovery Shadow power, you cannot use this talent again until the next full heal-up.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you use a Shadow power, gain temporary hit points equal to your level + Charisma modifier, twice at champion tier, and thrice at epic tier. For powers with an ongoing effect, you only gain the temporary hit points when you activate it. (Shadow Walk is considered a Shadow power for this feat)

#### Champion Feat

Once per battle, you can attack the target’s PD instead of AC with a Shadow power. This includes powers like Shadow Poison that give a benefit to other attacks.

#### Epic Feat

When you attack with a Shadow power, ignore any resistance the target may have.

---

### Shadow Walk

You gain the _shadow walk_ at-will power:

As a move action before you have used your standard action this turn, if you are not engaged, you can make the following "attack" against all nearby enemies, targeting the enemy among them with the highest Mental Defense.

**Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD

**Hit:** Remove yourself from play. At the start of your next turn, return anywhere nearby that you could have moved to normally during your turn, and deal double damage with your first rogue attack that turn.

**Miss:** No effect. You can't attempt to _shadow walk_ again until your next turn, but you still have your standard action this turn.

#### Adventurer Feat

On a miss, you can still use your move action normally (but still can't _shadow walk_ this turn).

#### Champion Feat

Twice per full recovery, you can reroll the rogue attack that follows your successful use of _shadow walk_.

#### Epic Feat

Twice per full recovery, you can reappear from your _shadow walk_ in a nearby location you wouldn't have been able to reach unimpeded physically, for instance, on the other side of a portcullis or door, or high up a wall.

---

### Skirmisher

You can use your Sneak Attack class feature with a melee attack against a target that you were not engaged with at the start of your turn, even if that target is not engaged with an ally.

#### Adventurer Feat

Enemies must succeed on a save to intercept you.

#### Champion Feat

If you disengage or pop free from an enemy during your turn, you gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

#### Epic Feat

When you are intercepted by an enemy while you move, make a Dexterity + Level attack roll against their MD. If you succeed, the intercept fails.

---

### Smooth Talk

Once per full recovery, convince your GM with an amazing line of patter while you are using social skills to speak or interact with NPCs associated with a particular relationship. If the GM is convinced by your patter, roll a normal save (11+). If you succeed, for the rest of the full recovery you can function as if you have a 2-point positive relationship with the relationship who seems to be in play. Thanks to your amazing gift of gab, for a short time, it's more or less true. (Note that these points replace any points you normally have with the relationship rather than adding to them.)

Failure on the Smooth Talk save generally arouses suspicions.

#### Adventurer Feat

Add your Charisma modifier to your Smooth Talk save rolls.

#### Champion Feat

Success with your Smooth Talk talent gives you a 3-point positive relationship instead.

#### Epic Feat

Even if you fail your Smooth Talk save, you still get the 2-point advantages with the relationship because the people you're speaking with can't be sure.

---

### Sniper

You take no attack penalty with bows and crossbows. You can use your Sneak Attack class feature with bow and crossbow attacks, as long as the target is nearby and engaged with an ally.

#### Adventurer Feat

You can use any rogue power with ranged attacks, as long as you can explain it logically. For example, you can shoot an arrow at a target’s pockets with Thief’s Strike, but the contents would fall to the floor if you’re not engaged with it.

#### Champion Feat

If you spend a move action to aim, you can target PD instead of AC with your next ranged attack that turn.

#### Epic Feat

If you spend a move action to aim, you always get your Sneak Attack with ranged attacks, even if there is no ally engaged with the target.

---

### Swashbuckle

Once per battle as a quick action, you can spend your momentum to pull off a daring stunt the likes of which others could scarcely conceive. You may make an attack as part of the stunt, but you'll need to roll normally for the attack. This is an improvisational talent.

As a swashbuckler, you do not need a difficult skill check to pull the stunt off.

---

### Thievery

You have 5 skill points in sleight of hand, without having to spend your normal skill points on it.

#### Adventurer Feat

Regardless of your level, you gain the bonus power _thief's strike_ in addition to your normal number of powers.

#### Champion Feat

Once per full recovery, you can deal full damage with _thief's strike_ instead of half damage.

#### Epic Feat

Twice per level, you can steal something with a successful _thief's strike_ that you would not be able to steal ordinarily, but that would require a bit of magic, e.g. a dream, a spell, someone's hope, a memory. The theft won't be permanent. Every full recovery, roll a hard save to determine whether you can keep what you stole for that full recovery. Also, you can never steal the same thing twice.

---

### Tumble

You gain a +5 bonus to disengage checks. In addition, while you are moving, if an enemy moves to intercept you, you can make one disengage roll per intercepting enemy as a free action to avoid that enemy, but you must stop the first time you fail any of those disengage checks.

#### Adventurer Feat

You ignore the penalty for disengaging from more than one enemy at a time.

#### Champion Feat

One battle per full recovery as a free action, you can declare that you're a tumbling fool and automatically succeed on your first disengage check each turn.

#### Epic Feat

Whenever you take critical hit damage, roll a hard save (16+). If you succeed, you somehow tumbled out of the way of whatever was about to hit you, and instead only take damage equal to the attacker's level.

---

### Unstoppable Momentum

When you gain momentum and didn’t have it already, you also gain a +2 bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.

#### Adventurer Feat

You gain the bonus to all defenses.

#### Champion Feat

You can use two interrupt actions between your turns, as long as you use both for rogue momentum powers.

#### Epic Feat

While you have momentum, you can rally as a quick action.

---

### Vampiric Drain

When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a living target, i.e. not a construct or undead, you heal hit points equal to the Sneak Attack damage.

#### Adventurer Feat

When you score a critical hit against a living target with a Sneak Attack, that target is also dazed (save ends).

#### Champion Feat

The target is now weakened instead.

---

## 1st Level Powers

### Clothesline

Momentum Power

At-Will (once per round)

Interrupt Action

requires momentum

**Trigger:** You intercept a creature.

**Effect:** You can make a basic melee attack against the intercepted creature. If your roll is a hit on natural 18+, the target creature is also dazed until the end of its next turn.

### Smoke Bomb

Quick Action

Full Recovery

**Target:** You

_Special:_ This power relies on some esoteric alchemical knowledge you’ve picked up during your career as a rogue, so it relies on you having a few small vials of strange reagents secreted on your person. It’s also worth noting that this power is one of the few rogue powers that doesn’t include an attack, so if you take it, you’ll have one fewer power-based attack than others. In exchange, you’re getting an effect usually reserved for outright magic

**Effect:** Until the end of the battle (or five minutes out of combat if you don’t stray too far), you become invisible until you attack or move to a location that isn’t nearby. Others see the smoke, but only you can remain unseen within it.

#### Champion Feat

Smoke bomb is no longer full recovery, and it’s recharge 16+ after battle.

You can hurl your smoke bomb at a nearby ally so they get the benefit instead of you.
