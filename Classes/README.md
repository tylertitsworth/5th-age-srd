# Classes

## Class Basics

### Weapon Damage Progression

For levels 1-6 PC weapon damage is calculated as a character deals 1 die of weapon damage per class level, plus their ability modifier (double the modifier at champion tier, and triple it at epic tier). For levels 7-10 see the table below.

| Level | WEAPON Dice |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | 1 |
| 2nd | 2 |
| 3rd | 3 |
| 4th | 4 |
| 5th | 5 |
| 6th | 6 |
| 7th | 8 |
| 8th | 10 |
| 9th | 12 |
| 10th | 16 |

See [Weapons](../Character-Rules/Combat.md#weapons) for more on weapon damage rules.

### Recovery Dice Progression

For levels 1-6 PCs have a recovery dice multiplier equal to their class level. For levels 7-10 see the table below.

| Level | Recovery Dice Multiplier |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | 1 |
| 2nd | 2 |
| 3rd | 3 |
| 4th | 4 |
| 5th | 5 |
| 6th | 6 |
| 7th | 8 |
| 8th | 10 |
| 9th | 12 |
| 10th | 16 |

### Spell Progression

Most of the spells used by characters have higher-level versions. You automatically gain access to the higher-level effects of a spell when you level up if you have a lower-level version of it.

Higher-level spells have higher damage amounts than their lower-level counterparts, but these amounts and effects are not cumulative. Amounts from the highest level spell you have are used. New effects from higher level spells are added to the spell's original effects.

### Shifting Choices during an Adventure

These are guidelines for allowing PCs to change their chosen spells, powers, talents, and feats during gameplay, subject to how forgiving you and your fellow players are.

---

#### Talents

Talents are a core element of your character. If you're going to rearrange your talents, something extremely significant needs to have happened in your character's story, some personal transformation or revelation. It is a sign of character transformation, usually coinciding with shifts in relationships.

Characters gain an additional talent at champion tier and epic tier.

---

#### Spells

You can change the spells you can cast after each full heal-up.

---

#### Powers

You can reselect your power choices when you gain a level.

---

#### Feats

If you've made changes to spells and powers, revise your feats appropriately. If the changes make sense for the character's story and the GM agrees, play them.
