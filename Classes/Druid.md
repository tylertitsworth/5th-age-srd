## Class Features

Druids use divine implements, such as symbols and staffs, to improve their spellcasting. They can choose up to three talents to have many useful aptitudes, or they can specialize by putting two points into one talent (and the other into another talent). A druid who chooses three separate talents is an _initiate_ in each one. Investing two points into a single talent allows the druid to become _adept_ in that talent, thereby gaining more power at the expense of options, and an _initiate_ in another talent.

As a druid, you choose whether you want to use Strength or Dexterity as the ability score you will use to determine attack and damage for your basic attacks. Choosing Strength as your melee attack ability score provides one significant benefit: your recovery dice become d10s instead of the d6s used by other druids. Choosing Dexterity as your melee attack ability score works well because Dexterity already boosts your initiative and ranged weapon attacks and might help your AC.

You never suffer from natural weather-related cold, heat, or exposure. You can go longer than most people without eating or drinking, but only a couple days longer.

You can also talk to plants and animals. If there is useful information to gain, roll a skill check that's appropriate for the tier. Talking to animals requires a hard DC, and plants usually require a ridiculously hard DC. A druid gains a +1 bonus when talking with animals for every talent spent on the Circle of the Moon or Circle of the Fang talents. A druid gains a +1 bonus when talking with plants for every talent spent on the Terrain Caster talent.

### Adventurer Feat

You can talk with plants and animals pretty much as often you like, and you gain a +5 bonus to any skill checks involved.

---

### Ritual Magic

Druids can cast primal [rituals](../General-Rules/Rituals.md).

## Druid Talents

Each of your talents unlocks pools of spells and powers that are not available to characters who lack the talent. Druids who choose to more talents in a circle become adepts and masters and gain additional benefits and powers in that circle.

### Druid Circles

Within each circle, there are three levels of mastery: initiate, adept and master. Your mastery level depends on how many talents you choose from a circle. Note that you gain three talents at level one as usual.

**Initiate:** You have one talent from the circle. This unlocks the abilities listed under that circle, such as a Circle of the Moon’s beast form.

**Adept:** You have two talents from the circle. This often unlocks more powerful abilities.

**Master:** All of your three talents are from that circle. Your abilities are similar to the adept level in most cases, but you benefit from having more spells in your chosen circle.

Each circle also grants a number of spells, powers or flexible attacks. The amount you get depends on your level and whether you are an initiate, adept or master

---

## Circle of Decay

This circle harnesses the destructive phase of the cycle of life. Droughts, plagues and rot are indispensable elements of life, as they cull the weak and the old and make way for the new. Its druids are also known as blighters or defilers. Many see themselves as closing the gap between death and new life.

However, there is a darker element to it, a destructive force that is outside of nature, a breaking of the cycle. It is a powerful, tempting magic, and blighters are always at risk of drawing more power from their surroundings than intended, leaving wounds that may never heal.

In the same way that the Lich King represents halting the cycle and clinging to life by unnatural means, some blighters seek to end life as it is, to create an eternally lifeless darkness.

### Circle of Decay Talents

You gain a bonus necromancer spell of up to your level.

You gain the Blighted Stench at-will spell as a bonus spell.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can switch one blighter druid spell for a necromancer spell without the level penalty.

The boon lasts until the next full heal-up, or until you meditate again. You can meditate as often as you like, but you can only have one boon at a time.

_Cave, dungeon, underworld:_ You can sense tremors in the ground and subtle echoes in the air, which allow you to perceive your surroundings even in total darkness.

_Desert, wastelands:_ Desiccate. Gain a +1 bonus to hit against creatures at full hit points.

_Forest, woods:_ Vitality. Increase your current and maximum hit points by twice your level.

_Hellhole, Abyss:_ You can sense the presence of demons within a few hundred feet.

_Ice, snowfields, tundra:_ Slow metabolism. Any “save ends” effects only start affecting you after the first failed save.

_Koru behemoth:_ Unstoppable. Gain a +1 bonus to saves.

_Mountains:_ Your mind is clear. Gain +1 to MD.

_Plains, overworld:_ Sunrays. When you make an attack, you can change its damage type to radiant.

_Ruins:_ All things end. Staggered enemies are vulnerable to your attacks.

_Ocean, island:_ You can swim in water like a dolphin. You have to surface to breathe.

_Swamp, lake, river:_ Flow. Gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks.

_Volcano:_ When an enemy engages you, deal fire damage equal to your level to them.

##### Adventurer Feat

While you have the boon of a terrain type active, you can keep using its spells even after leaving that terrain. This lasts until you switch out the boon, or until the next full heal-up.

##### Champion Feat

Once per battle or scene, you can use your bond with the land’s spirits as a quick action to perform a stunt without making a skill check. For example, river spirits could carry you to walk on water. This ends the boon effect.

For one battle per day, you can grant the boon to all nearby allies until the end of the battle as a quick action.

**Effect:** You create a group of floating lights that hypnotize creatures and cause them to follow. This can lure them into traps, ambushes, or natural hazards. Creatures who see the wisps must succeed at a save to avoid the effect. The save is normal difficulty (11+) if a creature’s MD is higher than their PD, otherwise it is hard (16+). In battle, saves are made at the end of a creature’s turn as usual. Out of battle, a creature can make a save every minute or so. Once a creature saves, the spell no longer affects it. The wisps stay for about ten minutes per spell level.

The spell does not come without strings attached, however. The target is put under a strong geas, chosen by the caster. The geas is a commandment of up to 25 words that the target has to follow. If the target commits an infraction against the geas, it causes mental and physical pain. If it willingly and grossly violates it, the spell ends and the target dies. The target also dies if the geas is removed. The spell cannot be cast on the same target twice; there is only one chance at Redemption.

## Circle of the Moon

Moon druids learn how to change shape into different forms of animals. They are also known as Circle of the Moons.

You learn how to shift your form in two ways: The scout form transforms you into a small, inconspicuous animal for quick reconnaissance of the surrounding area, while the beast form is a fierce, combat-ready form of a big predatory animal.

---

### Scout Form

You can shift into a small, stealthy animal that is useful for scouting the environment, but too weak for combat. You can shift back and forth between scout and humanoid form as a quick action, at-will, once per round. You also shift back if you take damage.

While in scout form, you gain a temporary skill 1d4+1-points related to your chosen animal form.

For every 5 points you beat the DC, you gain the next higher benefit, plus any lower ones.

_Failure:_ Nothing came of your scouting.

_Normal success:_ You gain a +4 bonus to initiative this battle.

_Hard success:_ As a free action at some point during the battle, you can grant one of your allies a reroll on an attack roll or save. That ally must take the new result.

##### Adventurer Feat

You can have three adventurer tier beast aspects active at the same time.

---

#### Beast Aspects

Beast aspects are powers you can use while in beast form to help you in battle. You must choose the aspects you know at each full heal-up. You can select any of the following aspects beginning at 1st level.

Normally you can use only one beast aspect at a time and using another aspect ends the previous one. The _beast form attack_ feats change that for the Circle of the Moon adept.

_**Beast aspect bonuses**_ **:** Many beast aspects provide bonuses to defenses or attacks. Circle of the Moon adepts can combine bonuses to the same stats from two aspects they are using simultaneously, an exception to the general rule that bonuses don't stack. For example, a Circle of the Moon adept using _bear aspect_ with its champion feat would have a +2 AC, and if the adept was also using _behemoth aspect_ with its champion feat, the total defensive bonuses for the adept would be +5 AC and +3 PD.

_**Effects:**_ Beast aspects only affect you while you are in beast form, which means that every aspect should be understood to read "while in beast form" for all its effects and powers.

Shifting out of beast form to humanoid form prevents a beast aspect from having any effect, but it doesn't end the aspect. When you shift back to beast form, the aspect is in effect again. Aspects last until the end of the battle.

_**Appearances:**_ The names of the aspects are a guide to what you might look like when channeling that beast, but it's also possible to decide that your usual beast form is, for example, wolf-like, and that using bear aspect or behemoth aspect merely adds bear-like or behemoth-like qualities to your standard wolf-shape.
