## Class Features

### Barbarian Rage

Once per full recovery, use a quick action to start raging. A rage lasts until the end of battle, or about 5 minutes.

While raging, you roll 2d20 to hit with your barbarian melee and thrown weapon attacks instead of 1d20. Use the higher roll for the attack. If you roll a natural 11+ with both dice and your highest attack roll is a hit, the attack is a critical hit!

_Recharge 16+:_ After a battle in which you rage, roll a d20 and add your Constitution modifier. On a 16+, you can use Barbarian Rage again later in the full recovery.

#### Adventurer Feat

Whenever the escalation die is 4+, as a quick action, you can start raging for free. (It doesn't count against your normal usage.) This rage lasts until the end of the battle, as normal.

#### Champion Feat

You can now start raging freely when the escalation die is 3+.

#### Epic Feat

You can now start raging freely when the escalation die is 2+.

---

### Fury

While you are raging, you can voluntarily end your rage early to use a fury. Make a melee attack and add the fury's effect to the attack. You gain 1 fury every 2 levels rounded down. You can swap a fury for another when you complete a full recovery.

#### Contagious Rage

Make a melee attack and resolve it normally, then increase the escalation die by +1.

#### Critical Devastation

If it hits, your melee attack is a critical hit.

#### Cunning Counter

Resolve the attack normally. The next time this battle you’re hit by someone you’re engaged with, you can immediately interrupt it by making a basic melee attack. If you hit, the enemy’s attack automatically misses.

#### Cyclone of Blood

Resolve the attack normally. The target pops free from you after the attack and is hampered until the start of your next turn.

#### Elusive Prey

Resolve the attack normally. For the rest of the battle, missed attacks do no damage to you.

#### Kill, Crush, Destroy

Resolve the attack normally. For this attack and the rest of the battle, you crit on a 16+ until you’ve delivered three critical hits, at which point your crit range returns to whatever it was before you used this Fury.

#### Pack Mentality

Resolve the attack normally. For the rest of the battle, you can make a bonus basic melee attack once per round when an ally hits an enemy you’re engaged with. This basic melee attack deals no damage on a miss.

#### Release the Beast

Resolve the attack normally. Once you’ve done so, break free of any movement-inhibiting spells, effects, or conditions.

#### Tooth and Nail

Make a basic melee attack, but target the enemy’s PD, not AC. For the rest of the battle, you can target your foes’ PD with your basic melee attacks.

#### Surprise Savagery

Resolve the attack normally. Your target’s MD is reduced by half your level for the rest of the battle.
