# Monster Rules

## Monster Stats

Only the heroes or exceptional monsters get to add the escalation die to their attacks. Consequently, most monster defenses start slightly higher than they would in a game that didn’t use the escalation die.

Most monster attacks deal a set amount of damage instead of being expressed as dice rolls like player character attacks. Monster abilities, triggered powers, critical hits, and the big difference between a hit and a miss vary the amount of damage the monsters deal.

Instead of requiring a separate die roll to see which attack monsters use, use the natural result of the creature’s d20 attack roll to see what other riders or attacks trigger. The standard default is 16+. Unpredictable monsters can have effects trigger on other rolls, such as odd/even, 5 or less, 6+, etc.

## Mooks

Mooks are obviously weaker monsters that you can cut down in large numbers. You track damage against the entire mob of mooks you’re facing rather than against individual mooks.

Mook hit points: A mook’s hit point value is one-fifth that of a regular monster, or even less. A 1st level kobold mook has 6 hit points. The difference from a regular monster is that damage accrues to the mook mob, and for each chunk of 6 damage that the kobold mook mob takes, it loses one mook.

For example, if the first attack against the kobold mooks deals 5 damage, it wouldn’t kill any mooks, but the GM would track the damage. If the second attack deals 10 damage (15 total), that would kill two mooks (6 each) and leave 3 damage on the mob.

Killing multiple mooks: Sometimes you deal a ton of damage with a melee attack against a mook and wind up killing mooks that weren’t engaged with you. The GM should take pains to allow you all the kills you get, letting you narrate attacks that cleave multiple foes, sudden leaps, whirlwinds of blows, mooks that faint or turn and run, or whatever it takes to make sure the mooks get their due. Storytelling unexpected mook kills is worth the table time.

It’s even more likely that a spell that targets several mooks will end up blowing away mooks who weren’t originally in the target zone, since each of the mooks will take their medicine separately. That’s as it should be. If the best thing the wizard can manage with a fireball is to blow away all the mooks in the battle, that’s a) awesome; and b) a fair chunk of damage the real monsters didn’t have to suffer.

Mook actions: Each mook moves and attacks on its own despite the fact that the mob takes damage en masse; that’s why you want to kill mooks quickly, so you’ll take fewer attacks. Like most other monsters, mooks deal fixed damage with their attacks and deal double damage if they score a critical hit with a natural 20. Mook status is apparent: Most of the time the PCs should know that mooks are mooks. In special cases, as ruled by the GM, it’s not obvious.

Multiple mobs: If a particular battle is all about fighting an enormous number of mooks, feel free to make things interesting by splitting them into a few different mobs with different initiative numbers and damage pools.

## Large and Huge Monsters

Large monsters generally have twice the hit points and can deal roughly double the damage of a normal-sized monster. They also count as two monsters when you build a battle (see page 186). Huge monsters have triple the hit points, deal triple damage, and count as three normal-sized monsters when you’re putting together a battle.

You don’t have to worry about these large and huge monsters being unfairly affected by spells that could weaken them or daze them or put them to sleep: most such spells have hit point limits. Particularly at champion and epic tier, the PCs will have to beat monsters down a bit before their control spells work well.

Sometimes the size of a monster isn’t backed up by how tough it is. Feel free to use big scary looking minis for monsters that turn out to have more or less normal stats. Similarly, you may end up wanting to use minis for a huge monster like a hydra that doesn’t look like a huge mini. Don’t worry about it.

Conversely, some normal-sized monsters are tougher than other monsters their size. We use the terms double-strength and triple-strength to refer to normal-sized monsters that have stats like large and huge creatures, and you should count them as large (double-strength) and huge (triple-strength) creatures when you balance battles.

## Burrow

Burrowing is another type of special movement rule that could have gone into the combat chapter. But it’s a monster thing rather than a type of movement we’re offering to the player characters, so we’ll handle it here.

Creatures that burrow can move underground with some effort. Unless otherwise specified, they don’t leave fully functional tunnels behind them. If it were dramatically necessary to follow a burrowing creature underground, well, maybe something could be worked out.

### Getting Into the Ground

A burrowing creature on the surface can use a standard action to try to burrow underground. Getting underground isn’t automatic; it requires a successful save that gets more difficult as the ground gets harder.

_Sand, dirt, most forest soil:_ Easy save, 6+

_Hard-packed dirt, loose rocks:_ Normal save, 11+

_Rock, caves, dungeon floors:_ Hard save, 16+

Failure indicates that the creature scrabbles on the surface to no effect, losing its standard action. Success means the creature can move underground, faster or slower depending on the hardness of the ground. A creature that’s burrowing is usually safe from attacks, out of line of sight and hidden in the earth.

### Breaking Throw to the Surface

It’s much easier for a creature to surface than to get underground. A burrowing creature only needs to use a quick action to break through to the surface (if it’s near the surface; see below). The usual sequence of a creature erupting to the surface is as follows: a move action from deeper under the ground to come close to the surface, close enough that people see there’s something coming, followed by a quick action to break through, and followed by a standard action attack.

Burrowing creatures like the bulette often begin and end combat underground, fleeing through the earth if given a chance. It’s less common for them to find reasons to move underground in the middle of a battle.

## Death Attacks & Last Gasp Saves

There are some monsters that are astonishingly deadly and can kill with a single attack (a death attack). “Kill” is used loosely here, in that a few of these monsters petrify or paralyze or otherwise entirely remove a PC from a fight.

Such attacks will specify that they offer “last gasp saves.” This means that a PC affected by such a power will slowly turn to stone, or slip into paralysis, or crumble to dust, etc. The first turn after an effect forces a PC to start making last gasp saves, the PC can take only one action (standard, move, or quick) during their turn and ends their turn by rolling a hard save (16+). If this first save fails, the PC is now helpless and can take no further actions except to roll more last gasp saves.

The last gasp save functions like a death save—success means the PC has thrown off the condition and will act normally on their next turn, and rolling a 20 means they can take their turn normally that round. Failing four last gasp saves in a battle means you turn to stone, are paralyzed, are liquefied, or are adversely affected as indicated.

In addition, an ally next to you can use a standard action to help you try to shake off the effect, letting you roll a bonus last gasp save that does not count against your four total if you fail it. When an ally attempts to help you shake off the death attack, it only requires a normal save (11+) for you to recover.

## Fear

Some monsters have a fear aura that will make it more difficult for PCs to attack them. Fear auras scale based on creature level, which determines the creature’s fear threshold number rated by hit points. While enemies that have that amount of hit points or fewer are engaged with a creature that has a fear aura, they are dazed (–4 attack) and do not benefit from the escalation die.

| Lvl | Fear Threshold (HP) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 7 |
| 1 | 9 |
| 2 | 12 |
| 3 | 15 |
| 4 | 18 |
| 5 | 24 |
| 6 | 30 |
| 7 | 36 |
| 8 | 48 |
| 9 | 60 |
| 10 | 72 |
| 11 | 96 |
| 12 | 120 |
| 13 | 144 |
| 14 | 192 |

## Group Abilities

A few monsters have abilities that are meant to be used a certain number of times in a battle by any one of the monsters in the group. For example, you don’t have to keep track of whether a given hobgoblin has used the well-armored ability, just keep track of how many times the hobgoblins have used the ability during the battle. The ability should tell you how many times it can be used per battle by the group as a whole.

As a rule, mooks can’t use group abilities.
