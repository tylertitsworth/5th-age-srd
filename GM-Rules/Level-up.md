# Leveling Up

Characters advance a level after three or four full heal-ups, i.e. between twelve and sixteen serious battles. The whole party levels up together.

## Benefits of Leveling Up

When you level up, you get these benefits:

- +1 to attacks, defenses, and skill checks.
- An additional die of damage with weapon attacks.
- More hit points (by class).
- An additional feat. Choose any feat whose prerequisites your character satisfies. Feats are classed as adventurer (can be chosen at any level), champion (can be chosen at level 5+), and epic (can be chosen at level 8+).
- The ability to wield an additional magic item. (See Magic Item Personalities & Quirks.)
- At 4th level, 7th level, and 10th level, you add +1 to three different ability scores.
- At 5th level and 8th level, gain an additional icon relationship point, and possibly more talents depending on your class.
- Possibly more powers and spells, and possibly an increase in their strength. (See Classes.)
