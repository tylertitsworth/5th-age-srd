# Loot: Treasure Rewards

Use the guidelines that follow to decide how many gold pieces and magic items to reward to successful adventurers.

The majority of treasure reaches the PCs one of two ways (a) as loot from climactic battles, or (b) as rewards after or before an adventure from a PC's icon connections.

## Gold Piece Rewards

The table below lists the highest amount of gold pieces you should consider awarding to each character in the course of an adventuring day. Rewarding less gold is fine.
