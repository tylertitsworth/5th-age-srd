# Loot: Treasure Rewards

Use the guidelines that follow to decide how many gold pieces and magic items to reward to successful adventurers.

The majority of treasure reaches the PCs one of two ways (a) as loot from climactic battles, or (b) as rewards after or before an adventure from a PC's icon connections.

## Gold Piece Rewards

The table below lists the highest amount of gold pieces you should consider awarding to each character in the course of an adventuring day. Rewarding less gold is fine.

| 13 | Mystical Components |
| 14 | Spirits |
| 15 | Religious Relics |
| 16-20 | Trade Goods |

#### Art

Paintings, sculptures, carvings – even rare poems, songs or musical compositions. Best place to sell: Concord.

#### Books

History books, philosophical treatises, collections of stories, technical manuals, spellbooks – books can be immensely valuable to the right buyer. Different topics sell best in different cities – Horizon for spellbooks, Santa Cora for philosophies, Drakkenhall for certain histories and books on etiquette (there are monsters there who now consider themselves Imperial citizens, and are determined to act like it).

#### Letters & Documents

A letter or legal document is an instant plot hook. A legal document could be a will (doubtless one that’s been lost for years) or a contract or treaty (‘hey, back in the 9th Age, a previous Archdruid swore to perform three great deeds for the Emperor – and that obligation got handed down to the current Archdruid. It looks like the 3rd Age ended before anyone called in the Archdruid’s debts, and this scroll got lost in the confusion back then. We’re the only people who know that the Archdruid owes the Emperor three favours. What do we do with this?’) Even mundane documents can be interesting in the right hands – a bill of lading for a merchant caravan clues the PCs into the possibility of more treasure elsewhere in the dungeon, while a letter of introduction could be used to get the PCs into the good graces of some noble or Icon. Documents that give the bearer a position of authority are especially amusing – _‘he who bears this scroll is rightwise imperial inspector of all temples, shrines and places of worship, and may close or fine such places should they be offensive or unsafe’_ is a great prize for a character with a negative relationship to the Church of the Dawn.

#### Maps

Accurate, up-to-date maps and charts are useful anywhere in the Empire, and absolutely vital outside it, or in places where the geography is… variable, such as Horizon. A map might reveal the location of buried treasure, or just mark hazards and currents at sea. This category also covers almanacs, timetables and other navigation aids and tools. Knowing when a Koru behemoth’s going to pass through a particular region, or being able to calculate the movements of a flying realm can be worth a lot in the right circumstances. Maps are especially prized in Newport, as the merchants there look to the lands across the Iron Sea for their fortune.

#### Mystical Components

Alchemical reagents like quicksilver, distilled moonlight, pixie spit or ground dragon egg; spell components like powdered demon-bat guano or phase spiderweb; religious components like water blessed by the Archdruid or mummy dust from the Necropolis. Optionally, spellcasting player characters could use these mystic components in their own rituals, getting a bonus to the skill check needed to successfully perform the rite. Otherwise, mystic components fetch a good price in Horizon.

#### Spirits

Spirits of all sorts throng the Empire.Spellcasters and other powerful entities trap them in specially prepared containers. Characters who are willing to overlook the ethical concerns can sell trapped spirits to an interested buyer, usually in Drakkenhall or Horizon.

#### Religious Relics

The remains of prophets and saints, relics and symbols from distant temples, objects sacred to one god or another, ceremonial robes and vestments, holy books and scrolls, even bits of dead deity can fetch a high price in Santa Cora.

#### Trade Goods

Fine cloth, spices, rare animal pelts and parts, wine and other exotic foodstuffs, especially Halfling or Elven ones. Rare goods can be sold in any city, but Shadowport specializes in dealing with items of uncertain provenance.

>_Note:_ Ah, you’re speaking of legitimate trade, of salvage and finder’s fees. Fat merchants who pay their taxes and have their scales inspected once a year. No, friend, if you want to make good loot, you’ve got to look… elsewhere. Drakkenhall and Shadowport are a good start, but I know a man who knows a man who knows a dead man. Buy me another drink, and I’ll tell you about the Bazaar of Hell and the Mortuary Market… - Stormcrow Jacar, “Merchant”
