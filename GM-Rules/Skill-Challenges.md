# Skill Challenges

Skill Challenges are a type of encounter GMs can run for structured roleplaying for a non-combat situation. The structure of the skill challenge places a definitive begining and end to the encounter with a discrete goal. Examples include convincing someone of an opinion, overcome a physical obstacle, survive a looming danger, etc.

## Scenes

A skill challenge is not necessary for a simple task, but rather a scene with many complex nested tasks that need to be done to achieve whatever discrete challenge the PCs are facing. Rather than using actions and combat abilities, players are tasked with only using skills to complete the challenge. The scene always begins with the GM presenting an obstacle and declaring a skill challenge, and then players determine how they will perform or aid a given task that their characters will address and then determine what skill they will use to address that task.

## Skill Challenge Philosophy

If the results of one or two successful skill checks would feel sufficient to model the story of the scenario and complete the obstacle or objective the players were tasked to overcome, then it is perfectly fine for that to be the case so long as it completes the task with a satisfactory outcome. A good skill challenge always has multiple routes or approaches for completion, and isn't shut down by a single failure.

A failure should never cause a PC to fail completely, failures should always create some amount of progress and players should be allowed to fail or try again as necessary, and only succeed partially where applicable. Should a player or party voluntarily choose to fail a skill check, they should inherit a consequence that does not outright stop them to achieving their goal.

## Format

A GM writes a task, which can be written like so:

```text
Primary Task: Find a safe way up the ocean cliff face.
Primary Skills: Athletics and Acrobatics
Prerequisite: Able to climb.
Hard - You make it up the cliff face with time to spare and without being noticed.
Moderate - You make it up the cliff face with no difficulty.
0 - You make it up the cliff face with some cost to HP. There are no guarantees as to time or stealth.
    Failure 1 - Dodge the falling rocks that come loose from people climbing above you.
    Failure 2 - Change from an awkward fall to a graceful dive before you hit the water.
```

Non-primary skills may not follow the same DC requirements based on the context provided by the player for how their character uses that skill. Usually non-primary skills increase the DC by one level.

Each time a player engages with one of the failure clauses, they get to reroll using a new skill check with a cumulative +2 bonus. Failure clauses come with penalties that are applied to these cumulative skill checks. In the example above, 2 failures would result in a failed task.

### Phases

Sometimes multiple phases are necessary to complete a given task. Each phase gets a number of failure conditions equal to the number of failures required to fail the primary task.

### Teamwork

Skill checks where one roll represents the efforts of the whole party are done with a lesser DC and with an additional +2 to the roll per aiding character.
