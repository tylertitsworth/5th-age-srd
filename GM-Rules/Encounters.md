# Building Battles

For adventure tier, levels 1-4, start with one enemy creature of the party's level per PC. At champion tier, levels 5-7, start with one enemy creature per PC, with each creature being one level higher than the PCs. At epic tier, levels 8–10, the monsters should weigh in at two levels above the PCs if they appear in equal numbers.

Lower-level monsters count as fractions of an adventurer-level monster, and higher-level monsters count as multiples. See the monster equivalents chart below.

## Monster Equivalents

| **Monster Level vs. Party Level (Adventurer)** | **Monster Level vs. Party Level (Champion)** | **Monster Level vs. Party Level (Epic)** | **Normal counts as…** | **Mook counts as…** | **Large counts as…** | **Huge counts as…** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 levels lower | 1 level lower | SAME LEVEL | 0.5 | 0.1 | 1 | 1.5 |
| 1 level lower | SAME LEVEL | 1 level higher | 0.7 | 0.15 | 1.5 | 2 |
| **SAME LEVEL** | **1 level higher** | **2 levels higher** | **1** | **.2** | **2** | **3** |
| 1 level higher | 2 levels higher | 3 levels higher | 1.5 | .3 | 3 | 4 |
| 2 levels higher | 3 levels higher | 4 levels higher | 2 | .4 | 4 | 6 |
| 3 levels higher | 4 levels higher | 5 levels higher | 3 | .6 | 6 | 8 |
| 4 levels higher | 5 levels higher | 6 levels higher | 4 | .8 | 8 |

## Mooks

At champion and epic tier, it takes 5 mooks to equal one standard creature. At first and second level, use 3 mooks as a standard creature if the mooks are the same level, an equivalent of .33. At third and fourth level, use up to four mooks per monster, or .25.

## Large Monsters

A large (or double-strength) monster counts as 2 standard monsters.

## Huge Monsters

A huge (or triple-strength) monster counts as 3 standard monsters.

## Monster Special Abilities

When you use monsters with especially nasty special abilities, be aware of the increased threat that they represent and take that into account.

## Unfair Encounters

To make the battle more difficult, consider outfitting the monsters in the battle with these features:

- Potent powers
- Nastier specials
- Weight of numbers
- Reinforcements
- Advantageous terrain

# Full Heal-ups

A party should get a full heal-up after approximately 4 regular battles, 3 hard battles, or 2 regular battles and 1 very hard battle.

For storytelling, try to sync full heal-ups with an appropriate event in the game world.

If the PCs find some special source of healing when they don't deserve a full heal-up yet, allow them to get one or two recoveries back and to make some extra recharge rolls.

If the party is able to rest and decides to heal-up ahead of time, they suffer a campaign loss. The story moves along, but the situation in the campaign gets noticeably worse for the party (at the GM's discretion).
