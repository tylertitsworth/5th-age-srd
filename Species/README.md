# Species

The major species included in 5th Age include humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and halflings. Your character need not be limited to these species, however. Minor species, including Dragonborn, Aasimar, Warforged, and Tiefling, are also referenced below.

Each species is associated with two ability scores, one of which can be chosen for your character's species bonus.

| **Species** | **Str** | **Con** | **Dex** | **Int** | **Wis** | **Cha** | **Any** |

The character also receives a separate class bonus. These two bonuses must apply to different ability scores.

Each species also provides the character a special power that can be used once per battle. (It is regained after a quick rest.) This is called the _racial power_.
