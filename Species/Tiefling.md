#### Curse of Chaos

Once per battle as a free action when a nearby enemy rolls a natural 1â€“5 on an attack or a save, turn their roll into a natural 1 and improvise a further curse that shows how their attempt backfires horribly.

A curse should have about the same impact as a typical once-per-battle ability. For example, a typical curse might lead to the cursed attacker dealing half damage to themself with their fumbled attack and being dazed until the end of their next turn. The GM may reward storytelling flair and/or limit the suggested effects of the curse.

##### Champion Feat

Whenever a nearby enemy rolls a natural 1 on an attack against you, you can use _curse of chaos_ against them without expending it.

#### Dangerous

At the start of each battle, gain a +3 bonus to your critical threat range. The bonus ends when you score a critical hit, or when you are first staggered.

##### Champion

If you are staggered for the first time in a battle and you have not scored a critical hit yet, you can make a basic melee attack as an interrupt action. The bonus from Dangerous applies to this attack.
