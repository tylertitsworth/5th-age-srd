## Feats

Characters choose a feat at 1st level, and at every subsequent level.

Feats appear in three tiers: adventurer feats, champion feats, and epic feats. Adventurer feats are available to any character between level 1 and level 10. Champion feats are available starting at level 5. Epic feats are available starting at level 8.

### Feats per Level

| **Level** | **Player Character** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 adventurer |
| 2 | 2 adventurer |
| 3 | 3 adventurer |
| 4 | 4 adventurer |
| 5 | 4 adventurer1 champion |
| 6 | 4 adventurer 2 champion |
| 7 | 4 adventurer 3 champion |
| 8 | 4 adventurer3 champion1 epic |
| 9 | 4 adventurer3 champion2 epic |
| 10 | 4 adventurer3 champion3 epic |

Since humans start with an additional feat at 1st level, add one to the number of adventurer feats humans possess all the way up the chart.

Most of the feats in the game are attached to specific class talents, attacks, and spells. If a feat is attached to a talent, power, or spell, you must have the talent, power, or spell in order to choose the feat. When there is more than one feat attached to a specific talent or power, you have to choose the lower tier feats before you pick up the higher tier feats.

### General Feats

These are general feats available to any character. A character can't take a specific feat more than once. A few general feats only have adventurer-tier versions; others also have champion- and epic-tier versions that can be added later in your career.

#### Further Backgrounding

##### Adventurer Tier

Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. You still can't go over the 5-point-per-background maximum.

##### Champion Tier

Add a total of 3 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 3 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. You still can't go over the 5-point-per-background maximum.

##### Epic Tier

Add a total of 2 points to backgrounds you already have, or choose 2 points of new backgrounds that make sense for your character. These points can take one of your backgrounds over 5, to a maximum of 7.

#### Improved Initiative

Adventurer Tier: Gain a +4 bonus to Initiative checks.

#### Linguist

Adventurer Tier: This feat allows you to speak enough arcana, dwarven, elven, gnomish, gnoll, goblin, orcish, and other standard humanoid languages to comprehend enough of what most other humanoids are saying or screaming during battle. You are not fluent in all these languages, no one will mistake you for a native speaker, and your vocabulary is adventurer-centric (heavy on words connected to danger rather than philosophy or emotions).

You can also read enough to get by in all these languages.

##### Champion Tier

You can speak, read, and write all the humanoid languages fluently. Stranger languages are no problem for you either. If someone is speaking it, you can figure it out.

#### Precise Shot

Adventurer Tier: When your ranged attack targets an enemy who is engaged with an ally, you have no chance of hitting that ally.

#### Rapid Reload

Adventurer Tier: Reloading a heavy crossbow now takes only a quick action. Reloading a hand or light crossbow is a free action.

#### Reach Tricks

Once per battle, tell the GM how you are using your weapon's reach to perform an unexpected stunt with a reach weapon such as a longspear or halberd. To use the stunt, you must roll a 6+ on a d20.

#### Ritual Casting

Adventurer Tier: You can cast any spells you know as rituals. Classes that are already ritual casters (cleric, wizard) don't need this feat. (See Rituals for ritual casting rules.)

#### Skill Escalation

Adventurer Tier: Twice per day, you can add the escalation die to one of your skill checks. Choose after you roll the check.

#### Strong Recovery

Adventurer Tier: When you roll recovery dice, reroll one of the dice and use the higher result. At 5th level, reroll two of the dice. At 8th level, reroll three.

#### Toughness

Adventurer Tier: You get additional hit points equal to half your baseline class hit points (rounded down). At 5th level, the total hp bonus increases to your baseline hp value. At 8th level, the total hp bonus increases to double your baseline hp value.
