# Races

The major races included in 5th Age include humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and halflings. Your character need not be limited to these races, however. Minor races, including Dragonborn, Aasimar, Warforged, and Tiefling, are also referenced below.

Each race is associated with two ability scores, one of which can be chosen for your character's racial bonus.

| **Race** | **Str** | **Con** | **Dex** | **Int** | **Wis** | **Cha** | **Any** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Human](./Human.md) | | | | | | | +2 |

The character also receives a separate class bonus. These two bonuses must apply to different ability scores.

Each race also provides the character a special power that can be used once per battle. (It is regained after a quick rest.) This is called the _racial power_.
