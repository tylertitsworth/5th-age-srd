## Dark Elf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Dex or +2 Cha

### Adventurer Feat (Elf)

#### Heritage of the Sword

If you can already use swords that deal d6 and d8 damage without attack penalties, you gain a +2 damage bonus with them. (This bonus doesn't increase miss damage.)

Otherwise, if your class would ordinarily have an attack penalty with such swords, you can now use them without penalties.

### Racial Power

#### Cruel

Once per battle, deal ongoing damage to a target you hit with a natural even attack roll as a free action. The ongoing damage equals 5 times your level. (For example, at 3rd level you would deal 15 ongoing damage against a single target.) As usual, a normal save (11+) ends the damage. A critical hit doesn't double this ongoing damage.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, you can instead use _cruel_ to deal 5 ongoing damage per level against an enemy you miss or that you roll a natural odd attack against.

## High Elf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Int or +2 Cha

### Racial Power

#### Highblood Teleport

Once per battle as a move action, place yourself in a nearby location you can see.

##### Champion Feat

Deal damage equal to twice your level to one enemy engaged with you before or after you teleport.

## Wood Elf

### Racial Bonus

+2 Dex or +2 Wis

### Racial Power

#### Elven Grace

At the start of each of your turns, roll a die to see if you get an extra standard action. If your roll is equal to or lower than the escalation die, you get an extra standard action that turn.

At the start of battle, you roll a d6. Each time you successfully gain an extra action, the size of the die you roll increases by one step on the following progression: (d4), d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. If you get an extra action after rolling a d20, you can't get any more extra actions that battle.

##### Champion Feat

Once per day, start a battle rolling a d4 for elven grace instead of a d6.
