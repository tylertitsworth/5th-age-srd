# Magic Items

There are two types of magic item. True magic items are permanent magic items used as loot during adventures and rewards for success. One-use items (mainly potions, oils, and runes) are magical treasure on which to spend hard-won gold. (See Loot: Treasure Rewards for notes on the wealth successful characters earn each adventure.)

## One-Use Items

The common types of one-use items include potions, oils, and runes.

## True Magic Items

Magic items are permanently enchanted objects. You can find them during an adventure or receive them as gifts and rewards from NPCs, but you'll seldom find anyone willing to sell one.

### Magic Item Personalities & Quirks

Every magic item in is alive, in a sense, and possesses a personality you have to interact with when you start using the item, establishing and maintaining a rapport with it. What that rapport means varies from item to item and is usually controlled by the GM. Some items talk with their user. Others communicate in bursts of emotion or slight motion.

Each item has a personality that is largely defined by its quirk. What you can count on as a default is that nearly all magic items want to be used and used well.

As an adventuring hero, you can handle a number of true magic items equal to your level. Items one tier above you count as two items, and epic items count as three items if you are an adventurer tier character.

If you are carrying and wielding a number of items that is equal to or lower than your current level, the magic item personality quirks will tug at you, giving you sudden urges and desires that will feel natural to give in to. But you'll be in charge.

If you are carrying and wielding a number of items that is greater than your current level, the magic item personality quirks are going to have more power over you. You're no longer running the show; instead, the magic items are, to some extent, running you. Herein lies a roleplaying challenge for the player and the GM.

## Chakras

You can only have one of each type of magic item (or one pair, for boots and gloves). Rings are one for each hand. You can have as many wondrous items as your overall capacity for magic items allows.

| **Type of Magic Item, aka Chakra** | **Default Bonus** **(often +1 adventurer, +2 champion, +3 epic)** |
| --- | --- |
| Armor, robe, shirt, tunic | Armor Class |
| Arrow, crossbow bolt, slingstone | No default bonus. The most common type of magic ammunition expands crit range by 1 |
| Belt, swordbelt, kilt, girdle | Recoveries per day |

### One Size Fits

Magic items shape themselves to suit the person who has given them their chakra.

## Magic Item Basics

Some magic items are available at any level, with greater bonuses or other effects for champion- and epic-tier versions. Others can be found only at champion or epic levels.

### Default Bonuses

Default Bonuses are on unless they specify otherwise. Magic necklaces have the only default bonus that is defined as provisional, a save bonus that kicks in when your hit points are low.

### Magic Item Powers

Unless otherwise specified, magic item powers with a recharge chance have to be activated and require a free action to use. They will also have a trigger condition that you must meet to use the item.

Magic item powers that do not specify a recharge chance or a specific usage pattern have powers that are always available.

The majority of magic item powers list a recharge number (6+, 11+, or 16+). You can count on using a recharge power once a day, but subsequent uses depend on successful recharge rolls. After the battle in which you've used an item's power, roll a d20. If your roll equals or exceeds the recharge number for that item, you can use that item power again that day. If the roll fails, the item power is expended until you take a full heal-up.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are a special type of unique magic item that have their own story. They're capable of providing multiple powers and benefits to their bearer, although that power comes at a cost.

Each artifact functions like a normal true magic item of its type, possessing the same default bonus, if any, and occupying one of its bearer's chakras, if that's how that type functions.

Unlike other true magic items, artifacts have more than one power, each with its associated quirk. When you first attune an artifact, choose one of its powers from your tier or lower. Each time you gain a level after that, you can choose to learn another of the artifact's powers from your tier or lower.

The artifact's default bonus depends on the highest tier power you have chosen from the artifact. If you have an artifact magic weapon but have only attuned one of its adventurer-tier powers, it functions as an adventurer-tier weapon, granting only a +1 bonus to attack and damage. Attune one of its champion-tier powers and the weapon will blossom into its champion-tier potential, granting a +2 bonus to attack and damage.

On the other hand, you don't have to attune all of an artifact's powers and you don't have to take them in order.

Only one artifact may be carried at a time. In addition, each power you choose from an artifact counts as an additional magic item for the number of true magic items you are allowed to use before your item's quirks overpower you.

Since acquiring an artifact is a major campaign event and such a big deal, even the icons will take notice. Each artifact should have a section on icon relationships that the artifact more or less requires. If you attune an artifact and don't have the required relationships, you will soon, as fate and destiny reshape around you! Otherwise the artifact will eventually disappear on you, finding a bearer more to its taste.
