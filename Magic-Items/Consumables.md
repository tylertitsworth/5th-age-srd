# Consumables

## Potions

You can buy potions that fall in the tier of the environment you're in. You can carry as many potions as you wish. Drinking a potion takes a standard action, even if you don't have it in hand already. Feeding a potion to an unconscious ally is also a standard action.

You can only be under the effect of a single potion at a time. If you're using a potion that has a lingering effect, drinking another potion ends the first effect. Non-healing potions tend to have effects that last until the end of a battle, or around five minutes if you're prepping for a battle and drinking potions beforehand.

---

### Healing Potions

A healing potion lets the creature drinking it heal using one of their recoveries. Potions provide bonus healing on top of what you'd generally get with a recovery, but there's a hit point cap for the maximum healing you can get from a potion, no matter how well you roll your recovery.

### Healing Potion Costs

| **Tier** | **Cost** | **Effect** | **HP Cap** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adventurer | 50 gp | Recovery +1d8 hp | 30 |
| Champion | 100 gp | Recovery +2d8 hp | 60 |
| Epic | 200 gp | Recovery +3d8 hp | 100 |
| Iconic | 300 gp | Recovery +4d8 hp | 130 |

---

### Energy Resistance

When you drink one of these potions, you gain resistance to a single specified energy type dealt by creatures or hazards of a specific tier for the rest of the battle or for five minutes. Resistance from a potion is always 16+. Attackers of the tier covered, or lower, must roll a natural 16 or higher on their attack roll to overcome your resistance and do full damage of a type you're resistant to, otherwise they deal half damage. Damage from a source that's a higher tier than your potion ignores your resistance. See [Resistance](../Character-Rules/Combat.md#resistance). For the types of resistance available, see [Other Damage Types](../General-Rules/Combat.md#other-damage-types).

### Resistance Potion Costs

| **Tier** | **Cost** |
| --- | --- |
| Adventurer | 100 gp |
| Champion | 200 gp |
| Epic | 400 gp |

---

### Heroism

Drinking this potion gives the character a temporary incremental advance. This advance lasts for five minutes or the rest of the battle. You can’t double up on advances – if you’ve already taken your +1 to skills, you can’t take it again. You also can’t gain a new spell or power with one of these potions, unless the GM’s in a generous mood.

**Costs** 150 gp/300 gp/600gp.

---

### Fortification

For the duration of this potion, you get a +1 bonus to saves against effects caused by foes and hazards of the same tier or lower as the potion. Saves against higher-tier threats aren’t affected by the potion.

**Costs** 150gp/300gp/600gp.

---

### Mental Fortitude

This potion suppresses the animal furies and lusts of lycanthropes, and allows a wild werecreature to retain full control in hybrid or beast form, even in the full moon. For non-lycanthropes, it gives a +4 bonus to Mental Defense for one fight. Each time MD is targeted, the bonus drops by 1.

**Costs** 100gp.

---

### Salvation

You may immediately make a save against an ongoing save ends effect caused by a foe or hazard of the same tier or lower as the potion.

**Costs** 50gp/100gp/200gp.

---

### Rejuvenation

A draught of this potion removes fatigue, hunger and thirst. It’s as if you’d slept solidly for eight hours and had a square meal afterwards. You still need to wait until you get a full heal-up before you can refresh your powers and recoveries, but this potion takes care of basic necessities like sleep and food.

**Costs** 100gp.

---

### Trollblood

Trollblood potions give almost the same healing effect as a healing potion, but spread it out over time. When you drink a trollblood potion, you spend a recovery, and that recovery’s healing effect gets spread out over several rounds. With an adventurer-tier potion of trollblood, you regain one die worth of hit points at the end of each turn until that recovery’s exhausted. If you’ve got a Constitution bonus, then that applies to the first die roll only. For example, if a 3rd level character with a recovery of 3d8+3 drank a potion of trollblood, she’d regain 1d8+3 hit points at the end of the turn, then another 1d8 at the end of the next turn, and then a final 1d8 at the end of the third turn. Champion-tier potions restore two dice worth of hit points per turn; epic potions do three dice of healing.

The trollblood effect ends when you’re reduced to 0 hit points.

Despite the name, there’s more than troll’s blood in these brews. In fact, troll blood is probably the most palatable ingredient in there.

**Costs** 50gp/100gp/200gp.

---

## Oils

While potions affect creatures, magic oils affect items. Oils provide temporary magical enhancement to weapons, armor, and spellcasters' implements.

It's a quick action to pour magic oil on your weapon, implement, or armor. The effect lasts until the end of a battle or for five minutes before fading.

Each oil confers a bonus of +1 (adventurer), +2 (champion), or +3 (epic). Used on a weapon or a spellcasting implement, the bonus applies to attack and damage rolls. Used on armor, the bonus applies to AC.

Bonuses from oils don't stack with magic items' inherent bonuses. Use the higher bonus.

### Oil Costs

| **Tier** | **Bonus** | **Cost** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adventurer | +1 Oil | 100 gp |
| Champion | +2 Oil | 200 gp |
| Epic | +3 Oil | 400 gp |

---

### Elemental

Elemental oil doesn’t give a bonus to attacks or damage, but causes the weapon to deal a particular type of energy damage (fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, radiant, necrotic, force, thunder and the like). Elemental oil only works on weapons, not on implements or armor.

**Costs** 150gp per vial.

---

### Quelling

Oil of quelling temporarily suppresses the magical spirit of an item, for the duration of one fight or about fifteen minutes, whichever is shorter. The item still functions normally, but doesn’t have any quirks. When the oil wears off, though, the spirit wakes up cranky and mean, and is especially hard to control for some time afterwards. Champion-tier items need champion-tier oil of quelling to lull them into slumber; otherwise, they just get briefly drowsy.

**Costs** 50gp/100gp/150gp.

---

### Oil of Torment

This sticky unguent is hot to the touch. If you’re a magic item spirit, it’s agonizingly painful. Applying oil of torment to a weapon, implement or armor increases its bonus by +1 for the duration of the battle (turning a +1 sword into a +2 sword, for example) by whipping the spirit into a frenzy. The weapon also becomes cursed in some fashion, and this curse may linger even after the temporary bonus fades. Again, you need sufficiently potent oil of the right tier to affect an champion or epic-tier item.

**Costs** 100gp/150gp/300gp.

---

## Runes

Runes function exactly like magical oils, but in addition to the expected +1/+2/+3 bonus, each rune also provides an additional random enhancement to the item it is applied to. Roll for the effect when the rune is applied to the item. An item can only have one rune applied to it at a time.

### Rune Costs

| **Tier** | **Bonus** | **Cost** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adventurer | +1 Rune | 150 gp |
| Champion | +2 Rune | 300 gp |
| Epic | +3 Rune | 600 gp |

### ­Random Rune Effect on Armor

| **Roll** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| 01–20 | The bonus also applies to PD |
| 21–40 | The bonus also applies to MD |
| 41–60 | The bonus also applies to both PD and MD |
| 61–80 | As 41–60, and you can reroll one failed save while the rune is active |
| 81–100 | You can take your first rally this battle with a quick action (if you can already rally with a quick action, the action is free) |

### Random Rune Effect on Weapon

| **Roll** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| 01–20 | +4 bonus to opportunity attacks |
| 21–40 | Weapon gains an energy damage type such as fire, cold, etc., and deals +1d4 damage (champion: +2d6; epic: +5d6) |
| 41–60 | +4 attack bonus on first round of combat |
| 61–80 | Weapon deals +1d10 damage while escalation die is 3+ (champion: +4d6; epic: +3d20) |
| 81–100 | Reroll one missed attack roll with weapon |

### Random Rune Effect on Spellcasting Implement

| **Roll** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| 01–20 | +1 additional attack bonus if spell has only one target |
| 21–40 | Implement gains an energy damage type such as fire, necrotic, etc., and deals +1d4 damage (champion: +2d6; epic: +5d6) |
| 41–60 | +1 additional attack bonus with full recovery spells |
| 61–80 | +1 additional attack bonus if spell has more than one target |
| 81–100 | Reroll one missed attack roll with implement |

---

## Miscellaneous

### Antientropic Powder

This enchanted ash is popular with wealthy sorcerers who can’t seem to keep servants. When thrown at an area, the magic of this sparkling grey powder reverses entropy—things get cleaned, untidy messes become ordered, rust/rot reverses itself, etc. It’s also useful for adventurers who like sleeping in clean dry dungeon areas, or to sort large heaps of loot into neatly stacked piles of coins.

**Cost:** 25 gp for a small cottage’s worth of deep-cleaning and tidying. The effect is permanent, at least until the area becomes untidy and dirty once more.

---

### Clay of Flesh Renewed

When applied, this reddish clay knits together wounds, though it has more unsavory uses too (such as creating flesh golems). When used to stabilize the dying, the assisting character gains a +5 bonus to the stabilization roll, and if the roll succeeds, the dying character can heal using a recovery. Clay of flesh renewed can be used to re-attach severed limbs, even by those without the ability to magically heal others, provided the limb is fresh. Creating flesh golems or doing tricky non-magical surgery with this clay requires many doses. The clay works by bonding to wounds and transforming into new flesh. A sculptor-surgeon could use this as a means of fantastical cosmetic surgery with a successful skill check.

**Cost:** 200 gp.

---

### Dancing Shoes

These shoes have one good dance in them, but boy what a dance. The shoes only work for the tier the character is in, and can be used in a scene or in battle.

For a scene, you gain a +5 bonus to heroic-tier skill checks involving dancing, before bursting into flames once you stop dancing, taking your level times the amount shown below in fire damage as the shoes burn up. Higher-tier shoes are more expensive.

The first time you use them in combat, until the end of the battle, you can pop free from each enemy engaged with you as a move action (once per round). If you don’t pop free from enemies or move normally during your turn, you take 1d4 fire damage (champion: 2d8 fire damage; epic: 4d10 fire damage). The shoes turn to ash at the end of the battle.

**Cost:** 50 gp; champion 100 gp; epic: 200 gp.

---

### Dust of Eternal Slumber

Standard Action

Taken from graves of those that died due to dark sorcery, this dust sends beasts, dragons, giants, and humanoids into a slumber. Cast the wizard spell [sleep](../Classes/Wizard.md#sleep) at 3rd level as a close attack using an attack of +7 vs. PD (champion: 5th level spell, +13 vs. PD; epic: 9th level spell, +18 vs. PD) against a single creature engaged with you. If you roll a natural 1 on the attack roll, you are hit by the attack.

**Cost:** 200 gp; champion: 400 gp; epic: 800 gp.

---

### Enchanted Pearl Dust

Standard Action

This expensive powder removes poison from food and drink on which it’s sprinkled. If eaten (or fed), dust of the appropriate tier allows you to heal using a recovery if you have taken poison damage this battle, or allows you to roll a save with a +5 bonus against an effect or condition caused by an attack that deals poison damage (like ongoing poison damage).

**Cost:** 25 gp; champion: 50 gp; epic: 100 gp.

---

### Featherlight Skirt

Useful for high-wire performers, mountain climbers, and cat-burglars, this item compresses a lot of silk into a small space. When you fall, this jacket, robe, or shirt puffs out into a huge parachute-like bell of material, and you don't take any fall damage when landing. The skirt’s material is ruined afterwards, or perhaps can be used as a large tent.

**Cost:** 100 gp.

---

### Gilljowl Lozenge

This pill stinks of ripe fish, which isn’t surprising considering what it is made from. This pill grants the ability to breathe underwater for up to an hour.

**Cost:** 200 gp.

---

### Glowstone Lantern

This lantern has no candle or oil, but instead a glowing stone that lights an area well. The glowstone has a limited duration. After each scene where the lantern is used, roll a d20. On a natural 1–2, the glowstone is permanently extinguished.

**Cost:** 20 gp.

---

### Illuminated Chalk

This alchemically enhanced chalk stick glows in the dark, making it useful for marking dungeon intersections. Gain a +4 bonus to skill checks to follow a trail or avoid getting lost. The chalk lasts for one scene.

**Cost:** 5 gp.

---

### Lighting Quagmire

Standard Action

When this pouch of sand is thrown onto soil or gravel, the ground temporarily becomes knee-deep quicksand around it. Cast the wizard spell [hold monster](../Classes/Wizard.md#hold-monster) at 3rd level as a close attack using +7 vs. PD (champion: 5th level spell, +13 vs. PD; epic: 9th level spell, +18 vs. PD) against a normal-sized non-flying creature engaged with you. If you roll a natural 1 when attacking with the sand, you are hit by the attack.

**Cost:** 200 gp; champion: 400 gp; epic: 800 gp.

---

### Lubricious Catholicon

Quick Action

Roll twice for your next disengage check and use the higher result. This alchemical potion is the antidote to, and antithesis of, viscid paste.

**Cost:** 50 gp.

---

### Magic-in-a-Bottle

Quick Action

Alchemists often produce strange fumes and unstable admixtures while trying to create other items. This bottle contains something, but you won’t know what it is until you break the bottle and let whatever is inside out. Roll a random effect on the psion’s [high weirdness table](../Classes/Psion.md#high-weirdness-table). Using a bottle of a different tier means you roll twice, or three times if it’s a twotier difference. Take the result you prefer.

**Cost:** 25 gp; champion: 50 gp; epic: 100 gp.

---

### Mask of Face-Swapping

Standard Action

These magical disguises are used by thieves and assassins. Each one lasts for 1d3 + 1 uses. When used, you cast the wizard utility spell [change self](../Character-Rules/Rituals.md#change-self) at 3rd level (champion: 5th level; epic: 7th level). Afterward, the mask takes on your appearance.

**Cost:** 150 gp; champion: 250 gp; epic: 350 gp.

---

### Polymorphic Potion

This potion constantly changes color. Each potion changes the drinker’s form for an hour or so, but not in a way that’s useful as a disguise. Some potions might give you the head of an animal, others make you glow like a lantern, and some will turn your skin bright blue or translucent.

**Cost:** 50 gp.

---

### Mystery Potion

You know how it is—a trader buys a load of potions and gets an oddball thrown in as a bonus. Or maybe an adventurer brings a potion back from a dungeon, but who knows how old it is or what it started out as. Or maybe a novice alchemist wasn’t paying attention. When you drink a mystery potion of your tier or higher roll a d10:

| d10 | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Start making last-gasp saves. |
| 2 | Lose a recovery. |
| 3 | You are dazed until the end of your next turn. |
| 4 | Roll a random psion [high weirdness](../Classes/Psion.md#high-weirdness-table) effect. |
| 5 | This turn make a basic or at-will attack as a quick action. |
| 6 | Roll your next d20 roll twice and use either result. |
| 7 | Heal using a free recovery. |
| 8 | Recharge an expended recharge power or magic item power, or regain an expended racial power. |
| 9 | Regain an expended per battle or full recovery power (or two recoveries if you have no full recovery spell or power to regain). |
| 10 | Roll again twice and keep either or both results. |

**Cost:** 50 gp, champion: 100 gp; epic: 200 gp.

---

### Potion of Tongue-Swapping

This potion doesn’t really swap tongues, it just seems that way, and lasts for a scene. You can perfectly imitate the voice of whoever you’re thinking of when you drink it, and gain a +4 bonus to skill checks involving disguises or verbal imitation, as long as you have heard that person speak. The potion’s effects also allow you to speak the language of the person you’re imitating.

**Cost:** 60 gp; champion: 120 gp; epic: 240 gp; iconic: 480 gp.

---

### Power-Stone

These dwarf-made semi-precious gemstones hold reserves of magical energy. When mounted to a weapon, the power-stone grants a +1 bonus to attacks and damage with that weapon (champion: +2; epic: +3). When mounted to armor the power-stone grants a +1 bonus to AC (champion: +2; epic: +3). When you score a critical hit with a stone-mounted weapon, or when an attack against AC crits you, the power-stone cracks as you lose its bonus and take 5 force damage (champion: 15 force damage; epic: 35 force damage).

**Cost:** 300 gp; champion: 600 gp; epic: 1200 gp.

---

### Quick-Change Outfit

Quick Action

This clothing appears to be one thing, but is another. The first time you use this item’s power, the outfit shifts into its true form. The shape and volume of the two types of clothing is immaterial to the change: a breastplate can become a ball gown as easily as wizard’s robes can become beggar’s rags. A quick-change outfit can have non-magical armor as one of its two forms, though any bonuses or penalties are only applied while the outfit is in its armored form. Once the clothing switches to its true form, the magic ends; you can’t switch back and forth between two forms. These outfits are commonly used by those of Axis to make sure they are wearing the right outfit for the occasion, and, of course, by assassins.

**Cost:** 100 gp, plus the cost of both outfits.

---

### Ring of Burning Daylight

When worn, this ring begins to shine like sunlight. The ring’s magic allows a wearer of its tier to accomplish more than normal in a short span of time; mundane tasks that would take weeks can fit into a single full recovery, and journeys that would take days can fit into hours. The ring’s magic ends when the journey is over, the tasks are done, or the sun sets.

**Cost:** 60 gp; champion: 120 gp; epic: 240 gp.

---

### Straw-Man

This easily-destroyed construct will animate for about 10 minutes. Adventurers usually use them to check corridors for traps. If the construct matches the tier of the trapped area, each character gains a +4 bonus to detect traps in an area it moves through. Once a straw-man detects/springs a trap, it’s destroyed.

**Cost:** 60 gp; champion 120 gp; epic; 180 gp.

---

### Stretch-Rope

This expensive alchemically-created rope is stretchy and elastic. It will hold weight for 1d3 uses before breaking, and characters using it for a skill check that requires stretchy rope gain a +4 bonus.

**Cost:** 1 gp per foot.

---

### Tangle-Rope

A short length of weighted, enchanted rope. As a quick action, cast the wizard spell [hold monster](../Classes/Wizard.md#hold-monster) at 3rd level using +7 vs. PD (champion: 5th level spell, +13 vs. PD; epic: 9th level spell, +18 vs. PD) against a single normal-sized nearby creature.

**Cost:** 300 gp; champion: 600 gp; epic: 1200 gp.

---

### Trauma Doll

This small doll absorbs pain, and then releases it on another living being. As a quick action, a nearby creature (including you) of the doll’s tier or lower is no longer considered staggered, and a different nearby creature (also including you) is now considered staggered. This doesn’t affect hit points totals, only who’s staggered for effects that trigger on that state. This effect ends when the first creature either heals above half of its maximum hit points, or drops to 0 hp. The doll freezes and shatters after it’s used.

**Cost:** 100 gp; champion: 200 gp; epic: 400 gp.

---

### Viscid Paste

Quick Action

This paste sticks things together with an almost supernatural strength. Gain a +4 bonus to a skill check of the appropriate tier to do something like bar a door or climb up a wall.

**Cost:** 20 gp; champion: 40 gp per; epic: 80 gp.

---

### Wakebread

Baked with secret elven herbs, this bread lets you stay alert and keep watch all night, and still gain the benefit of a full rest provided you don’t do anything too strenuous while on watch.

**Cost:** 10 gp.

---

### Weird Healing Salve

Standard Action

These salves are usually made from random ingredients that can have strange additional effects. Heal using a recovery, and if your recovery roll result is odd, a random psion [high weirdness](../Classes/Psion.md#high-weirdness-table) effect occurs.

**Cost:** 40 gp; champion: 80 gp; epic: 160 gp.

---

### Wizwood Wand

This implement is useful to apprentice wizards. The wand default bonus grants a +1 bonus to attack but not damage with spells cast through it, but it breaks the first time you roll a natural 1 on a spell attack or ritual skill check using the wand.

**Cost:** 300 gp.
