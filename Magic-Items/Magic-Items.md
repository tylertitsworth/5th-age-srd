# Magic Item Descriptions

Each name/characteristic includes its action type, usage, description, power. Magic items in the adventurer tier can be used by players in any tier. Magic items in the champion tier cannot be used by players in the adventurer tier. Epic level magic items are limited to epic-tier players. Optionally, the GM can apply the quirk of an item, if applicable, to the item's user.

## Arrow, Crossbow Bolt, Slingstone

In general, ammunition is one-use, hit or miss, and, like other one-use items, ammunition doesn't confer quirks on its user.

### Default Bonus

Expands crit range by 1 (adventurer, champion, and epic tier, always a 1-point expansion rather than 1 point per tier). Ammunition takes the bonus of the weapon that shoots it, just like mundane ammunition does.

---

### Adventurer

#### Energy

This ammunition has been enchanted with one of the following types of energy: acid, cold, fire, holy, lightning, thunder. An attack using this ammunition deals that type of damage.

---

#### Forceful Impact

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, the target also pops free from each enemy engaged with it.

---

#### Incineration

Creatures slain by ammunition with this property are reduced to ash when they die. They’re not going to come back as zombies, or rise as vampires, or be used as husks by demons.

---

#### Keen

When you make an attack with this ammunition, the crit range of that attack expands by 1 (usually 18+ including the default bonus).

---

#### Lethal Strike

You deal +1d10 damage on a hit (champion: +2d10; epic: +4d10).

---

#### Lucky Stray

On a miss, you can make a basic ranged attack against another foe that is near the target or along your line of sight to the target (between you and the original target or past the original target).

---

#### Nemesis

This ammunition has been enchanted against one of the following groups of monsters: dragon, giant, orc, or undead. An attack against the designated nemesis with this ammunition can be rerolled once if it misses. When you use this ammunition, however, it allows each monster of the same group to reroll one attack against you that misses this battle. If you use this type of ammunition two or more times against the same creature group this battle, monsters of that type can instead reroll each attack against you that misses this battle (once per attack).

---

#### Seeking

You deal +4 damage on a miss (champion: +10; epic: +25).

---

#### Spellbound

You may cast one of your Close spells onto the missile. When the missile is fired, the spell takes effect as if you were standing at the spot where it fell. So, you could charge an arrow with lightning fork and fire it at a far away group of foes. The missile must be fired quickly before the magic burns it out – either cast your spell and shoot the missile yourself next round, or cast the spell on an ally’s missile and have them fire it.

---

#### Twin

When you attack with twin ammunition, a second projectile materializes out of the first and targets the same or a different enemy. Make a free action basic ranged attack for it with a +8 attack bonus instead of your normal bonus (champion: +12; epic: +16).

---

#### Vulnerability

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, if the target is from the same tier or lower than the ammunition, it's also vulnerable to all attacks until the start of your next turn.

---

#### Wing-clipper

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, if the target is from the same tier or lower than the ammunition, it loses the _flight_ ability (save ends). If the target is presently flying, it must attempt to land during its next turn.

---

### Champion

#### Flaming

Bursts into fire as it flies. You deal 8 extra ongoing fire damage on a hit (epic: 20 ongoing fire).

---

### Epic

#### Death

When you hit with this ammunition and deal damage, if the target has 40 hp or fewer after the hit, the creature drops to 0 hp. If it hits but fails to drop its target, the ammunition is not used up. It must of course be retrieved.

---

#### Dolorous Bolt

This crossbow bolt inflicts a special form of ongoing damage – the victim takes 50 damage, but suffers that damage every day instead of every round. There is no save against this damage, and nothing less than a [Wish](../Classes/Wizard.md#wish) spell can remove it. The damage recurs at the exact same time every day. Some creatures may simply die, but anyone worth shooting with an epic-tier weapon probably has the hit points and healing to survive the ongoing hit point damage. The constant pain and the knowledge that the agony’s going to recur every day for as long as they live are other matters entirely.

>_Note:_ One of the Crusader’s madmen shot the King of the Stone Giants with a dolorous bolt. Around the same time, you start hearing stories that the Dark Gods can cure any injury if you swear to serve them forever. Think the Crusader’s mad enough to risk a war with the giants on the off-chance of snaring their king’s soul? - Hresta, half-elf ranger

---

#### Uncanny

It warps the forces of necessity and miracle as it flies. When you attack with this ammunition, use the target's lowest defense instead of the defense your attack would normally target.

---

## Armor, Robe, Shirt, Tunic

Most magic armor powers can apply to heavy armor, light armor, or even no armor (robes or other clothing).

### Default Bonus

+1 AC (adventurer); +2 AC (champion); +3 AC (epic).

---

### Adventurer

#### Clever Step

Light Armor

You gain a +4 bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks.

**Quirk:** Likes to dance little jigs.

---

#### Heedlessness

You gain a +4 bonus to all defenses during your first turn in battle.

**Quirk:** Needlessly provocative.

---

#### Iron Will

The default AC bonus applies to Mental Defense as well.

**Quirk:** Prone to abstract speculation.

---

#### Last Stand

Heavy Armor

You gain a +4 bonus to AC while you have no recoveries left.

**Quirk:** Has a high pain tolerance.

---

#### Of the Guarded Heart

The AC bonus from your armor applies to your MD as well.

**Quirk:** Mistrustful.

---

#### Perfection

Heavy Armor

You gain a +1 bonus to all defenses while at maximum hit points.

**Quirk:** Made uneasy by the sight of blood.

---

#### Perseverance

Quick action

Daily

If you are staggered, you regain an expended power as if you had taken a quick rest. You automatically regain a once-per-battle power, but a recharge power requires a successful recharge roll. You can regain a species power, class power, or magic item power this way.

**Quirk:** Repeats stories over and over.

---

#### Spellthread Shirt

_Recharge 11+:_ When you cast a spell that targets yourself, you also charge the shirt with that spell. When the shirt is charged, you may activate it as a free action to gain the benefits of that spell for one round. The spell has to be one that lasts for an entire battle – you can’t charge it with dimension door or teleport. For example, if you cast blur on yourself in one fight, you could use the shirt to blur again for one round in a later battle. The shirt’s appearance changes to reflect the stored spell – if you’ve got a feather fall in it, it’s puffy and silky; if it’s storing water breathing, it’s green and clings to your skin.

**Quirk:** Compelled to change your hairstyle and wardrobe to complement the shirt.

---

#### Splendor

Enemies engaged with you take a –2 attack penalty against allies without splendor.

**Quirk:** Fastidious about clothing and gear.

---

#### Stone Flesh

The default AC bonus applies to Physical Defense as well.

**Quirk:** Extremely stubborn.

---

#### Unyielding Plate

Heavy Armor

_Recharge 16+:_ You don’t fall unconscious when reduced to 0 hit points – you can keep fighting, but you’re weakened (-4 to all attacks and defenses), and you don’t need to make death saves. You still die when reduced to a negative score equal to half your maximum hit points. (Champion: Three quarters of your maximum hit points; epic: equal to your maximum hit points).

**Quirk:** Cold and unsympathetic.

---

#### Warding

You gain resistance 12+ against attacks targeting Physical Defense or Mental Defense.

**Quirk:** Stretches and meditates whenever inactive.

---

### Champion

#### Plate of the Automaton

Heavy armor

While wearing this armor, you may enter into a trance that fulfills your need for sleep, but lets your body continue with some mindless repetitive task. You could, for example, ‘sleep’ while marching, or while patrolling for monsters, or while digging graves. You are vaguely aware of your surroundings while in a trace; you could even hold a conversation or fight a battle, but you’d be hampered throughout in the latter case.

**Quirk:** Monotonous speech.

---

#### Robe of Preservation

_Recharge 16+:_ This soft grey robe automatically activates when you are knocked unconscious. It teleports you to a safer location nearby – it might bring you out of the room in a dungeon, or drop you at the feet of the party cleric, or just stuff your unconscious body into a cupboard. The robe remains behind when you teleport, falling empty to the ground where you stood.

**Quirk:** Heedless of danger.

---

#### Unrelenting

You may drain and heal using Recoveries from your nearby allies on a two-for-one basis – one nearby ally loses two Recoveries, you get the healing benefit of one of them. The armor activates automatically when you go below 50 hit points. You get to pick who you drain – they don’t get to refuse, but can cut you off forever after being drained. If an ally cuts you off, you may never drain them with the armor again.

**Quirk:** Callous.

---

## Belt, Swordbelt, Kilt, Skirt, Girdle, Sash

### Default Bonus

Increase your maximum recoveries: by 1 (adventurer); by 2 (champion); by 3 (epic).

---

### Optional Default Bonus

Don't increase your recoveries depending on the tier. Instead, the item gives you one extra recovery. But when you heal using that recovery, you don't roll and the hit points you heal depend on the tier of the item: 20 hp (adventurer); 50 hp (champion); 125 hp (epic).

---

### Adventurer

#### Blademaster's Belt

One magical sword sheathed on this belt gains a +2 bonus to recharge rolls for its own powers.

**Quirk:** Worries too much about tiny details.

---

#### Brutal Vigor

_Recharge 6+:_ When you rally, make a basic attack.

**Quirk:** Plays with their weapons.

---

#### Giant Health

Like most belts, this increases your maximum recoveries by 1 (champion by 2, epic by 3). In addition, one bonus recovery given by this particular belt is giant-sized – you get to roll d12s instead of your normal recovery dice when you spend it. You choose when you tap this extra-large recovery.

**Quirk:** Formidable appetite.

>_Note:_ Formidable smell, too. Wear that belt for long enough, and you start smelling like a giant’s armpit. You don’t notice it in Horizon, because that whole place stinks of sulfur and ozone and bat guano anyway, but just take a sniff at the Archmage’s guards when they go traveling. - Hresta, half-elf ranger

---

#### Girdle of Oaths

Like other magic belts, this one increases your maximum recoveries by 1 (2 for champion, 3 for epic). The girdle of oaths can also give you an unlimited number of bonus recoveries – the catch is that each one comes with a cost, and the cost keeps rising. The first free recovery requires a minor service or complication. After that, the price goes up. Whatever the belt asks of you will always be useful to the belt’s true master, so it might ask you to recruit others to their cause, or donate magic items or treasure, or slay enemies of the belt's true master.

Refuse, and at the worst possible moment, the belt will take back the health it’s given you, and you’ll take damage equal to the healing provided by the belt in the past.

**Quirk:** Mercenary in all things.

---

#### Glorious Rally

When you rally, you gain 4 temporary hit points that last until the end of your next turn (champion: 10 temp hp; epic: 25 temp hp).

---

#### Heroic Resolve

_Recharge 11+:_ You can use a recovery to prevent all damage from an attack (including ongoing damage), but not effects.

**Quirk:** Has terrible heartburn.

---

#### Hungry Scabbard

A weapon drawn from this swordbelt inflicts an extra 1d8 damage with your first hit each battle (champion: +2d8; epic: +4d8). However, if you don’t kill something that bleeds in the fight, the weapon still demands its thirst be sated; lose a recovery after the fight if you fail to slay a creature, or if you’re fighting things that don’t have blood.

**Quirk:** Unwholesome taste for red meat.

---

#### Last Word

When you heal using your last remaining recovery, you heal 30 additional hit points (champion 75 hp; epic: 200 hp).

**Quirk:** Stubbornly independent.

---

#### Potion Belt

_Recharge 16+:_ Drink a potion stored on this belt as a quick action instead of a standard action. (It also provides slots for up to six potions.)

**Quirk:** Constantly attempts to refill everyone else's drinks. Or potions. Or ration bags.

---

#### Resilience

_Recharge 16+:_ When you rally, you can use a second recovery to heal after using the first (and seeing the recovery roll).

**Quirk:** Grinningly optimistic.

---

#### Victory by Inches

You must carry a single magic melee weapon that you keep attached to this item for it to manifest its power. When using that weapon, apply the weapon's magic bonus to miss damage.

**Quirk:** Have a hard time taking no for an answer.

---

### Champion

#### Resurgence

_Recharge 16+:_ When you drop to 0 hit points or lower, heal using a recovery before falling unconscious.

**Quirk:** Bursts forth with wildly optimistic comments from time to time.

---

#### Sash of Suppleness

_Recharge 6+:_ A silky sash worn as a belt. When an attack hits your AC and deals 16 damage or less, change that hit into a miss (epic: 40 damage or less).

**Quirk:** Always stretching, even when it would be more polite or sensible to not be doing so.

---

### Epic

#### Kilt of the Mad Archmage

_Recharge 11+:_ When you drop one or more foes with an arcane spell attack, heal using a recovery and gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls with spells until the end of your next turn.

**Quirk:** Roll eyes and giggle too often for comfort.

---

#### Totem Kilt

A hide-and-fur skirt bedecked with garish tribal charms, totemic symbols, and spirit knots. You can reroll the first death save you make each battle. Add +2 to the roll.

**Quirk:** Sometimes speaks with the voices of ancestors.

---

#### Vitality

Whenever you take ongoing damage, roll an immediate save to end the effect without taking damage first.

**Quirk:** Fascinated by patterns.

---

## Book, Scroll, Tome, Grimoire

Mastering a book requires a course of study and practice, usually accomplished over a day or more. Sometimes a book will reject a reader, leaving them either confounded or disturbed.

### Default Bonus

None.

---

### Adventurer

#### Codex of Foreshadowed Victory

_Recharge 16+:_ When you roll initiative, gain a +10 bonus to your roll after seeing it.

**Quirk:** Jumpy.

---

#### Compendium of Observed Ritual

Exhaustively complete and exhaustingly pedantic, this book purports to record all known rituals, barring a few diabolical ones censored by the compilers. While following the instructions in this book makes ritual casting take much longer (2d4 hours, and you can’t use high arcana to hasten matters along), it can also improve the efficiency of the ritual. Roll a d6; on a 6, then the components used to fuel the ritual aren’t expended, as the book describes a method to tap some other power source.

**Quirk:** Becomes obsessed with pointless ceremony and ritual.

---

#### Manual of Enlightened Flesh

You gain a +1 bonus to all skill checks based on Str, Con, or Dex.

**Quirk:** Takes heightened satisfaction in their own physical prowess.

---

#### Scroll of Darkness

This mind-blasting scroll reveals the secrets of the Dark Gods. The scroll is only a few pages long, but you find yourself reading it again and again, and each reading brings new insights into the nature of life and death. As long as you possess the scroll, you have a3-point skill related to knowledge of evil deific figures.

**Quirk:** Not so much a quirk as a health and safety warning – if this item takes over, then you’ll be sacrificing virgins on altars in no time.

---

#### Scroll of the Fortuitous Outlook

(Quick action – once per battle)

Make a recharge roll for a recharge power you expended this turn (including a magic item power) If successful, you regain that power this turn.

**Quirk:** Paranoid about the weather.

---

#### Scroll of Seven Subtle Serpents

_Recharge 6+:_ When you make a melee attack based on Dexterity, Intelligence, or Wisdom, evoke a special ability of your choice. Pick the ability from one of the following options after seeing whether the attack is a hit.

- Deal +1d6 damage on a hit (champion: +2d8; epic: +4d10).
- Deal +1d4 damage on a miss (champion: +2d6; epic: +4d8).
- Gain a +1 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn.
- Pop free from one enemy.
- Gain 1d10 temporary hit points (champion: 3d8; epic: 8d8).
- Roll a save against an ongoing save ends effect.

Quirk: Always in constant motion, or swaying gently when still.

---

#### Scroll of the Unerring Shaft

_Recharge 11+:_ When you miss with a ranged weapon attack, turn that miss into a hit, dealing your ranged basic attack damage with the attack instead.

**Quirk:** Sings snatches of nonsense.

---

#### Tome of the Divinities and their Deeds

_Recharge 16+:_ When you cast a divine spell, heal using a recovery and add +1d6 hit points to the total (champion: +2d8 hp; epic: +4d10 hp).

**Quirk:** Sees the hands of the gods operating subtly through the natural and social world, and makes others aware of it.

---

#### Tome of the Open Mind

_Recharge 16+:_ When you roll a skill check using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma and dislike the result, reroll the check.

**Quirk:** Annoyingly curious.

---

### Champion

#### Manual of the Numinous Realms

_Recharge 11+:_ Bound in orichalchum, written in silver ink on the finest vellum, and illustrated with strange diagrams that move on their own, the manual describes the interplay of elemental forces and spiritual currents that underlie the illusion we call reality. By manipulating these fundamental levers of reality, you may accomplish great feats of magic. When you miss all targets with a daily spell, you give up that spell’s miss effect (if any) and cast another daily spell as a free action.

**Quirk:** Fears unlikely consequences and improbable coincidences. If only you fools could see how all things are interconnected, you too would fear the calling of the birds in the trees when the wind is from the west and there’s a woman in a red shawl nearby!

---

#### Manual of Puissant Skill at Arms

_Recharge 11+:_ When you miss with a melee attack, reroll the attack using +15 as your attack bonus instead of your own bonus (epic: +20). If an arcane spellcaster reads this manual, it hurts their brain and permanently reduces their maximum hit points by 4 (epic: by 10).

**Quirk:** Constantly checking self out and flexing, and seems to want to be caught doing that.

---

#### Manual of Victory

_Recharge 16+:_ Those who study this monograph on total warfare come to understand that a bloodless victory is a hollow one, and that it is only from sacrifice and suffering that true glory arises. The first time one of your allies falls on the field of battle (drops to 0 hit points or is otherwise slain or incapacitated), choose one of the following effects:

- Increase the escalation die by 1
- Take an immediate standard action for free
- Increase your weapon damage dice by one step (d6s become d8s, d8s become d10s) for the remainder of the battle

Be warned, though – if the fallen ally is healed and returns to the fray, it throws your tactical calculations off, and you no longer benefit from the escalation die for the rest of the battle.

**Quirk:** Refight famous battles in your head or on the tabletop.

---

### Epic

#### Labyrinthine Grimoire

_Recharge 16+:_ When this book is opened, your body falls to the ground, helpless. Your mind enters a seemingly infinite library, a maze of book-lined passageways and vaults that contains all the knowledge of the universe. You may swap out any one spell for any other spell you have access too – once you find that spell in the library. At the start of your turn, make a skill check using a suitable magical skill against DC 25. If you succeed, you wake up. If you fail, you’re still stuck in the library and remain helpless for another round. If you roll a 1, well, something crawled out of the library and into your body while you were detained, like a book-spirit desperate to get written into reality. You can use the grimoire outside of combat, but it’s up to the GM how often you get to make skill tests to find your way back – life or death situations are great for focusing one’s mind on the task at hand.

**Quirk:** Bibliophile.

>_Note:_ My master once owned the Labyrinthine Grimoire, and consulted it some sixty-nine years ago. He has yet to return. If, when searching the infinite library, you happen across an absent-minded old wizard with a purple beard, please break it to him that he’s been dead for sixty-four years and a considerable amount of paperwork has built up in his absence. - Gerolt, the Eternal Apprentice

---

#### Tome of Arcane Mysteries

_Recharge 11+:_ When you make an attack roll with an arcane spell, after finding out whether the attack hits, change the attack roll to a 10 instead of the natural roll.

**Quirk:** Doodles insane geometrical designs.

---

## Boots, Shoes, Sandals, Slippers

### Default Bonus

Disengage checks and other checks involving fancy footwork: +1 bonus (adventurer); +2 bonus (champion); +3 bonus (epic).

---

### Adventurer

#### Boots of Elvenkind

You gain a +4 bonus to skill checks to walk quietly.

**Quirk:** Develops a love of elegant elven poetry.

---

#### Boots of Rhythm

You have a +4 bonus to dance checks.

**Quirk:** Loves to learn new dances.

---

#### Boots of Sure Feet

You can walk or run normally through terrain that would usually slow one down, such as rubble, undergrowth, muck, etc. The boots don't protect you against damage or similar effects incurred from inhospitable terrain.

**Quirk:** Becomes exceptionally picky about diet.

---

#### Boots of Ferocious Charge

Whenever you move to engage a foe first and then make a melee attack against it during the same turn, you deal +1d6 damage, hit or miss (champion: +2d8; epic: +4d10).

**Quirk:** You like to start fights as much as you like to finish them.

---

#### Face-Stomping Boots

_Recharge 6+:_ When a foe you’re engaged with becomes staggered, you may automatically inflict 5 damage on them immediately (champion: 10 damage; epic: 25 damage). You don’t have to be the one who staggered them to trigger this item.

**Quirk:** Hates bugs and other things that crawl.

---

#### Sandals of the Slippery Eel

_Recharge 11+:_ Reroll a failed disengage check.

**Quirk:** Loves puns.

---

#### Slayer's Boots

_Recharge 11+:_ When one or more creatures attempt to intercept you while you're moving to engage an enemy during your turn, you dodge past them instead so they can't intercept.

**Quirk:** Recites death poems of ancient heroes. At length.

---

#### Wise Eyelet Boots

Quick action

_Recharge 16+:_ If you were the last creature to take its turn this round, you pop free from all enemies.

**Quirk:** Hesitates before speaking.

---

### Champion

#### Sandals of Wall Striding

_Recharge 6+:_ Until the end of your next turn, you can move normally along a wall or vertical surface as if you were flying.

**Quirk:** Has compulsion to snatch small insects out of the air and pop them into mouth when they think no one is watching.

---

#### Winged Shoes

_Recharge 11+:_ You can fly for the next 1d3 rounds.

**Quirk: Hasty.**

---

## Bracers

Bracers occupy the same type as magic melee weapon in terms of bonuses.

Monks get magic-weapon style powers from magical bracers. A monk wearing magical bracers can't use a magical melee weapon at the same time.

Non-monks generally don't benefit from bracers.

Bracers have the same types of powers as other melee weapons. Use the melee weapon magic items to determine bracer powers, and assign one of the following monk-specific quirks.

- Speaks too often in terse shouted syllables.
- So disciplined that dancing, hanging out, and even sitting down is a mental hurdle.
- Unable to sleep without performing an exhausting workout first.
- Certain that intimacy with another being depletes one's ki.
- Unable to avoid helping smaller innocent creatures in distress.
- Always rises at least an hour earlier than everyone else in their group, community, or adventuring band.
- Unable to curse or say negative things about people, even if they are true.
- Uncomfortable sleeping in the same spot they slept in the night before.
- Likes to paint watercolors in their spare time.
- Longs for victory in official martial tournaments.
- Trash-talks during battle.
- Tells detailed stories about great martial arts battles of previous centuries.
- Always uses a quick action to pose over the prone body of a just-defeated foe.
- Corrects everyone else's posture, sometimes even in the middle of battle.
- Has a fondness for sweets, followed by a punishment regimen of only fish soup.
- Compelled to climb stairs using their hands instead of feet.
- Insists on always moving silently, breezing in and out of situations that in social terms require small noises and acknowledgements.
- Can't abide "fancy" food without heartburn (or at least complaints of heartburn).
- Insists on being the first to go into a room.

## Cloak, Mantle, Cape

### Default Bonus

Physical defense: +1 PD (adventurer); +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic).

---

### Adventurer

#### Adroit Avoidance

_Recharge 6+:_ When an attack or effect deals ongoing damage to you that a save ends, you can roll an immediate save against it.

**Quirk:** Doesn't notice social slights or insults.

---

#### Demonhide Cloak

_Recharge 11+:_ Demons are hard to kill. That means it’s hard for them to die. You’re wearing a cloak made from the skin of a trapped demon. Roll 1d6 at the start of battle to see what power the cloak can manifest in this fight if you choose to activate it.

| d6 | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | +4 temporary hit points (champion: +10; epic: +25) |
| 2 | Resist Fire 6+ (champion: 11+; epic: 16+) |
| 3 | True Seeing – you are immune to invisibility and see through any illusions |
| 4 | Demonic speed – once per battle at the start of your turn, roll a d8. If the result is equal to or lower than the escalation die, you get to take an extra standard action this round (champion: d6; epic: d4) |
| 5 | If a nearby demon teleports, you may choose to teleport with it. You arrive engaged with the demon. |
| 6 | +1 to all attacks against demons

**Quirk:** Goddamn smart-mouth cloak thinks it’s so smart, speaking through your mouth.

---

#### Elven

Add +4 to checks to hide in natural surroundings.

**Quirk:** Prefers the finest things in life; of course, they are elven.

---

#### Evasion

_Recharge 6+:_ When you take damage from an opportunity attack, take 20 less damage from it (champion: 40; epic: 100)

**Quirk:** You can't answer a question directly even if you want to.

---

#### Invisibility

Standard action

_Recharge 16+:_ You become invisible. As you’ve got to hold the cloak around you to maintain the invisibility, you can’t take standard actions while invisible, which means (mostly) no spellcasting or attacking. You can drop the invisibility at the end of any turn; you become visible immediately, and can act normally on your next turn.

**Quirk:** Paranoid about other invisible creatures, lurking invisibly nearby.

---

#### Recovery

Quick action

_Recharge 16+:_ You heal using a recovery and add +4 hp to the total (champion: +10 hp; epic: +25 hp).

**Quirk:** You grow small extra appendages that slowly wither away over days or weeks.

---

This long cloak with a full hood keeps you warm and dry, regardless of the elements, barring full immersion in water or other liquid.

**Quirk:** Prefers the outdoors.

---

#### Stalwart

_Recharge 16+:_ When an attack against your Physical Defense hits, make the attacker reroll the attack and use a PD of 15 instead (champion: 20; epic: 25).

**Quirk:** Always the last to retreat or avoid danger.

---

### Champion

#### Guardian

_Recharge 11+:_ When a foe you're engaged with targets your ally with an attack that doesn't include you, make that enemy target you instead of that ally. Declare your choice before the attack is rolled. (Epic: recharge 6+.)

**Quirk:** Compelled to the defense of others, even those who might not need defending.

---

### Epic

#### Inviolability

_Recharge 16+:_ When an attack against your Physical Defense hits, change that hit into a miss instead.

**Quirk:** Attempts stunts of toughness and daring that a person less convinced of their invulnerability might be wise enough to avoid.

---

## Gloves, Gauntlets

### Default Bonus

None.

---

### Adventurer

#### Ambidexterity

_Recharge 11+:_ When you roll a natural 16+ with your first melee attack during your turn while wielding a weapon in your off-hand, make a melee attack with the weapon in your off-hand as a free action, using +10 as your attack bonus (champion: +15; epic: +20).

**Quirk:** Writes with both hands at the same time on different parts of the page. It freaks people out.

---

#### Arcane Contact

These gloves improve your ability to contact, detect, and distinguish supernatural forces, provided you can touch some material object connected to a force. The gloves provide no protection against the supernatural forces that touching an artifact might usher into your soul.

**Quirk:** Always cracks knuckles.

---

_Recharge 16+:_ When you miss with a ranged weapon attack, reroll it using +10 as your attack bonus (champion: +15; epic: +20).

#### Gloves of Mind Rot

_Recharge 6+:_ When you hit one or more foes with an arcane spell attack, deal +1d10 psychic damage to one target of the attack (champion: +2d10; epic: +5d10).

**Quirk:** The texture of your skin seems wrong to everyone else, but you know it's all in their minds and often explain that to them.

---

#### Jeweled Glove

_Recharge 6+:_ When you cast a divine spell, allow one nearby ally to roll a save against one ongoing save ends effect as a free action.

**Quirk:** Alternately paranoid that people are looking too closely at your precious jeweled glove and upset that people aren't paying enough attention to your amazing jeweled glove.

---

#### Musical Touch

While you wear these fine silk gloves, you can play any musical instrument without instruction. The gloves, however, don't make you any more of a musician than you already are.

**Quirk:** Hums and picks up tunes easily.

---

#### Spell Deflection

_Recharge 16+:_ These heavy metal gauntlets bear complex runes of negation. When wielding a melee weapon, you can parry a spell targeting you or an ally as a free action. To parry the spell, you roll Strength + Level vs. the caster’s MD; if you hit, the spell is cancelled and the caster loses the action they were using for the spell. If it was a limited-used spell, that use is expended if your natural attack roll was even. (It’s basically the Counter-Magic bonus spell in glove form).

**Quirk:** Rudely interrupts people when they’re talking.

---

#### Steel Fist of the Crusader

_Recharge 6+:_ When you hit a demon with an attack, you may roll an extra d6 for damage for every positive relationship die you have with the Crusader (champion: d8; epic: d12).

---

### Adventurer

#### Circlet of Approachability

While wearing this circlet, in regular social situations, you appear to others as someone who belongs there. You easily fit in with new groups of people, unless there is some particular reason for others to be suspicious. The circlet has no power in unusual social situations.

**Quirk:** Peppers speech with needless foreign words.

---

#### Helm of Fortunate Dodging

(Recharge 11+, and see below)

When an enemy misses you with an attack against your AC or PD, change that miss into a fumble (no damage or possibly a negative outcome).

(Recharge 6+): When your turn starts, roll a save against one ongoing save ends effect.

**Quirk:** Favors traditional battle hymns.

---

#### Skullcap of Wit

You can banter with a lively wit. If you already have a lively wit, it doesn't make much of a difference. Interpret this ability narrowly enough that it might provide a bonus to a die roll that anyone really cares about only once in a campaign.

**Quirk:** Banters with lively wit.

---

#### Wizard’s Hat of Conjuration

Once per day, you can pull a useful non-magical common item out of this hat. The item must be able to fit through the brim of the hat, so you couldn’t pull out a siege engine or a horse. You could, though, produce a sword, or length of chain, or a saw, or a delicate vase decorated with salacious paintings of frolicking kobolds. The hat can also produce small living creatures, like rabbits or cats or doves or maybe even the aforementioned frolicking kobolds.

**Quirk:** Kleptomania; you unconsciously steal items and stick them inside your hat. Sometimes, you can’t find them again afterwards.

---

#### Wizard’s Hat of Loyalty

This hat always returns to you. No matter the circumstances, it always finds its way back. Put into prison? You’ve got your hat. Ambushed in the middle of the night? You’ve got your hat. You could be stripped naked, hurled through a portal into the Abyss, and carried by a demonic roc to its nest hundreds of miles away in a nameless infernal mountain range – and you’ve find your hat waiting for you there. You may keep up to three small items in the brim of the hat (scrolls, potions, gemstones, snacks), and they’ll be with the hat when it comes back to you.

**Quirk:** Compelled to treat the hat as a pet.

---

### Champion

#### Crown of Brimming Wisdom

When you fail an Intelligence skill check, you may roll another d20 immediately and add it to your total. The trouble is, if you pass, you start rambling on in a pedantic and absent-minded way for a number of rounds equal to the second d20 roll, as the crown pours more information than you actually needed into your brain and it spills out through your mouth. You can’t do anything else while rambling, although if you’re attacked, you may roll a hard save (16+) to notice, in which case you finish your erudite lecture once the fight concludes.

**Quirk:** Voracious reader.

---

#### Helm of Terror

When the escalation die is 3 or higher, you cause fear like a monster of the same level. Better yet, nearby allies who would fear you if you were a monster (i.e. their hit points are lower than your fear threshold) are immune to fear as long as you’re around.

**Quirk:** Enjoys intimidating people a little too much.

---

### Epic

#### Crown of the Mighty Strike

_Recharge 16+:_ This slim but elegant crown wants to share your glory and thus needs you to be glorious. It continually presses you to take bold actions. If the escalation die is 3+, use your next daily attack power this battle as a quick action.

**Quirk:** Likely to make bold statements or undertake bold actions, especially by reflex.

---

## Necklace, Pendant

### Default Bonus

---

#### Last Legs

You gain a +1 bonus to saves whenever you have one or fewer recoveries left (champion: two or fewer, epic: three or fewer).

**Quirk:** Loves long-shot bets.

---

The stones in the necklace breathe, ever so slightly. You gain a +5 bonus to death saves, if failure would kill you. You also gain a +5 bonus to last gasp saves.

**Quirk:** Chides others for taking risks when they have lesser magical protection.

---

#### Momentous Harmony

The pendant brings out the best in other magic items you carry, so that their quirks turn more positive, or at least become weaker if they cause trouble. If you go over your magic item limit, the pendant ceases to function (including the default bonus) and the formerly subdued magic items express themselves with renewed fervor.

**Quirk:** Treats all their magic items well—talks to them as if they're alive, refers to them as "children," etc.

---

#### Paired Talisman of the Familiar

_Recharge 16+:_ You can cast an at-will spell through your familiar, as if you were standing in the familiar’s place. This means you could zap someone with a Close spell from Far Away – your pet frog hops up to them and unleashes your shocking grasp.

**Quirk:** Takes on behavioral traits from familiar.

---

#### Paragon

_Recharge 16+:_ This necklace changes shape and jewels depending on the species of the wearer. When you use this necklace, you gain another use of your species power in the battle.

**Quirk:** Sometimes unwittingly speaks in a language that sounds like it could be the original language of their species, if anyone else could understand it.

---

#### Talisman of Mortification

_Recharge 11+:_ An ugly, spiky lump of metal scrapes against your chest, reminding you that your flesh is mortal, but the cause is eternal. Before you roll a save, you may sacrifice any number of recoveries. For each recovery sacrificed, you gain a +1 bonus to your roll.

**Quirk:** Refuses to yield.

---

#### Water Breathing

_Recharge 6+:_ This band of aquamarine and pearls enables you to breathe water for a short time, usually about five minutes. The effect wears off slowly, so you'll have warning to get to the surface.

**Quirk:** Hiccups in stressful situations.

---

## Rings

### Default Bonus

None.

---

### Adventurer

In addition to a +2 bonus to saves against confusion, this ring lets you specify which of your nearby allies you attack when confused. Choose your special friend when the confusion starts, and you may even specify yourself.

**Quirk:** Keeps an enemies list. Checks it twice.

---

#### Glory

This brilliant, gem-encrusted ring gives you an aura of status (and whatever that entails). Everyone can see it, even if they don't know why.

**Quirk:** Becomes more and more obsessed with the idea that all their accomplishments are undeserved and that they themselves are frauds. This obsession often drives them to heroic acts.

---

#### Instant Vengeance

_Recharge 16+:_ When you take damage from an enemy's attack, choose one ally you can see. That ally can make a basic attack (melee or ranged) against the attacker as a free action.

**Quirk:** Sticks close to their friends, real close.

---

#### Iron Grip

When you make a skill check involving climbing, holding something, or otherwise using your hands to grip things, you can use +10 as your bonus in place of your normal bonus (level + ability mod + skill; other magic item bonuses still count) (champion: +15; epic: +20).

**Quirk:** Loves to arm wrestle, thumb wrestle, drum fingers on tables, etc.

---

#### Jack of All Trades

When you make a skill check, if your bonus for that check is +1 or +0, you gain a +2 bonus for your skill bonus instead (if your bonus is +2 or higher, this ring has no effect).

**Quirk:** Talks as though they know everything.

---

#### Protection

_Recharge 11+:_ Gain a +2 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn (champion: PD too; epic: also MD).

---

#### Relentless Strike

Standard action

_Recharge 16+:_ Make a basic attack ignoring any effects that give you an attack penalty, prevent you from attacking, keep you from taking actions, or force you to reroll the attack. You can also use this ring's power while you're stunned, even though you couldn't normally take an action.

**Quirk:** Regularly finds copper pieces and other minor valuables on the ground.

---

#### Thief's-Eye

While the ring is on your finger, if you shut both eyes and concentrate, you can see through the ring, allowing you to peer around corners and such.

**Quirk:** You're always prying into things that should maybe be left shut; doors, topics of conversation, taboos….

---

#### Wild Heart

Animals accept you and may even show you affection. The animals, however, still react normally if you threaten them, and well-trained guard animals are especially wary of you.

**Quirk:** Seems out of place in civilization.

---

## Shield

### Default Bonus

Increase your maximum hit points: by +4 (adventurer); by +10 (champion); by +25 (epic).

On a hit, the attack deals 2d6 damage; on a miss, it deals 2 damage (champion: 4d8 damage, or 5 on a miss; epic: 8d10 damage, or 12 on miss).

In combat, the eye seems to look pleadingly at any foe who’s strong enough to shatter your shield, as if hoping to be released from its unnatural state.

**Quirk:** Always watching people. You sleep with your eyes open.

>_Note:_ Hey, I know that… eye. -Grunbolt, dwarven adventurer

---

## Staff

A staff counts as both a wand (arcane spells) and a symbol (divine spells). Staffs are champion or epic items only. Epic staffs don't like to be around lesser staffs, and do not abide wands.

Attack and damage with an arcane or divine spell or attack: +2 (champion); +3 (epic).

---

### Adventurer

#### Spellforce Staff

_Recharge 16+:_ Activate this staff as a free action to ignore any dazed, hampered or weakened conditions afflicting you when making an arcane spell attack. The staff doesn’t get rid of the conditions – it just amps up your spell so it blasts through them.

**Quirk:** SHOUTS A LOT.

---

### Champion

#### Diabolical Staff

(Recharge: 16+, but see below)

You can evoke the power of the staff to gain additional attention and power from the spirits of darkness. When you roll for relationship advantages with a villainous relationship, treat a 16+ as a 20. If you don't roll a 16+, the staff recharges automatically during your next quick rest.

_Recharge 16+:_ The power of this golden staff can only be invoked by a spellcaster who has a positive or conflicted relationship with any ruling relationship.

**Quirk:** Becomes certain that they are destined to rule.

---

#### Wrath-Staff

_Recharge 6+:_ This simple staff of iron-shod wood oozes blood when activated. When you kill a foe with a spell, you may activate that staff and have any excess damage spill over to a nearby mob of mooks. The mook’s relevant Defense must be equal to or lower than that of your original target.

---

## Symbol, Holy Symbol, Relic, Sacred Branch

Sometimes a symbolic magic item is a gem or rune that can be attached to any of various holy symbols. Typically a divine spellcaster pries the gem or other adornment off a foreign holy symbol and affixes it to their own mundane holy symbol. Symbols are only appropriate for adventurer- and champion-level characters. For epic-level spellcasting items, get a staff.

### Default Bonus

Attack and damage with a divine spell or attack: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion).

---

### Adventurer

#### Blasphemous Symbol

_Recharge 11+:_ When you cast a spell that allows an ally to heal using a recovery, you may choose to invoke this relic’s power before the recovery is rolled. The ally may reroll any recovery dice that roll a 1 or a 2. That ally is then bound to perform a service for an evil deific figure.

If the ally refuses to perform the service (or if the service is deemed too petty or meaningless), then both you and that ally are cursed in some fashion. The nature of the curse depends on the service, but it’s more likely to be something unpleasant or loathsome that does not interfere with your ability to serve the deific figure. Expect boils.

**Quirk:** Unctuous.

---

#### Chosen One, Sign of the

When you cast your last divine daily spell, roll a save. If you succeed, you don't expend the spell.

---

#### Dominating Truth, Symbol of

_Recharge 11+:_ When you cast a divine spell that affects one target with a limited amount of hit points (for example, _turn undead_), you can instead have that spell affect two targets with half the hit point requirement or less.

**Quirk:** Never admits they're wrong.

---

#### Gathered Power, Symbol of

(Recharge with full heal-up)

When you use this symbol during a quick rest, you regain an expended daily adventurer-level spell (1st or 3rd level, in practice) (champion: champion-level spell, 5th or 7th).

**Quirk:** Has one-track mind.

## Wand

Wands are only appropriate for adventurer- and champion-level characters. For epic-level spellcasting items, get a staff.

### Default Bonus

Attack and damage with arcane spells or attacks: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion).

---

### Adventurer

#### Body Breaking, Dagger of

This rune-covered bronze dagger also works as a wand. When you cast an arcane attack spell using this dagger/wand, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage with that spell if it targets PD.

**Quirk:** Scratches self unnervingly.

---

#### Corrected Devastation

_Recharge 16+:_ Activate this wand immediately after rolling damage for a daily spell that hit. That spell never happened and is not expended. Gain a free action to cast an at-will spell instead. Everyone on the battlefield is somewhat alarmed by the fact that the blazing ball of fire suddenly vanished, but that’s wizards for you.

**Quirk:** Prone to sudden bursts of rage over trivial problems.

---

#### Flaring Wand

Quick action

**Quirk:** Uses pedantically circumlocutious phraseology.

---

#### Reckless Abandon

_Recharge 16+:_ This wand turns any attack spell that targets a randomly determined number of targets into a reckless one. You may increase the number of targets by 1d3, but any allies engaged with any of the targets also take the damage from the spell. So, if you use this wand to cast breath of the white recklessly, the spell affects 1d2+1d3 targets, but any allies engaged with any of those targets also gets attacked.

**Quirk:** Becomes extremely callous, especially where the lives of allies are concerned.

---

#### Rod of Banishment

**Quirk:** Dismissive.

Melee Weapon

_Recharge 11+:_ For the rest of the battle, or until it misses with an attack, this weapon may make basic attacks on its own in any turn in which you don’t use it to make an attack. It uses a +5 as its attack bonus (champion: +10; epic: +15). This basic attack may not trigger flexible attacks; treat it as if an ally was attacking an enemy.

**Quirk:** Runs out of water after producing about 30 gallons. Cannot produce a geyser if recently emptied.

---

#### Driftglobe

This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. While you are nearby it you can speak its command word and cause it to emanate daylight. You can speak another command word as a standard action to make the globe rise into the air and float above the ground. The globe follows you and stays nearby and if it can't stay nearby it sinks gently to the ground, becomes inactive, and its light winks out.

**Quirk:** The intensity of the light is determined by its mood, can be disheartened easily.

---

#### Dwarven Mug

One in four mugs of ale you drink from this mug will be magically transformed into the very finest non-magical dwarven ale. If your relationship with the mug is good, the variety might even suit your current mood and the odds of getting a good brew might improve in your favor. But really, who's going to complain about putting down a second, or even third, mug for the chance to get a taste of the best stuff? When that excellent ale does show up, you can share a sip or two with a friend, but other attempts to capitalize on this mug's magic will just shut it down until it can find a more suitable owner.

**Quirk:** Speaks in dwarven, especially while drunk, even if ordinarily unable to speak dwarven.

---

#### Eldritch Claw Tattoo

Your unarmed attacks are considered magical and you gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls with unarmed attacks.

After closing the bottle is disperses after 10 minutes, but moderate and strong winds can disperse it quicker.

---

---

#### Lore Bottle

A bottle of translucent glass, sealed with lead, with a ghastly face that peers out at you. When you ask it questions, it answers in the form of vague hunches. For tough questions, the face might fade out for a while, apparently searching somewhere for an answer. Owning the bottle gives you +2 bonus to Intelligence-based skill checks, if you have the time (and privacy) to consult the lore bottle. Chances are, your particular lore bottle has some sort of specialty or bias, which you will discover only through use. Unlike most magic items, lore bottles can often be found for sale, but you probably don't want those.

**Quirk:** The connection formed with the face in the bottle can be compelling and unsettling, as the spirit literally "gets in your head." Each bottle has a different effect on its owner.

---

#### [Luckstone](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:luckstone)

---

#### Pearl of Power

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended power. Once you have used the pearl, it can't be used until you complete a full recovery.

---

#### [Rope of Climbing](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:rope-of-climbing)

---

#### Sending Stones

Sending stones come in pairs, with each smooth stone carved to match the other so the pairing is easily recognized. While you touch one stone to telepathically communicate with the bearer of the other stone. If no creature bears the other stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone and don't cast the spell.

---

#### [Soul Coin](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:soul-coin)

---

#### Lesser Spellwrought Tattoo

A _Badge of the Waters_ is given only to those who have earned a place among the _Watchers_. While wearing the badge, you gain a +2 bonus to AC if you aren't using a shield.

**Quirk:** The badge is vigilant in its quest to protect the weak and seek justice.

---

#### Chime of Opening

This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. You can strike it as a standard action, pointing it at an object nearby of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound can't reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens.

The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.

---

#### Horn of Blasting

You can use a standard action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast against nearby creatures that is audible from very far away. Creatures within the effect take 5d6 thunder damage and are dazed (save ends). Creatures can roll a resist 8+ check to take half damage and not be dazed. Creatures made of glass or crystal take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.

When using the horn roll a 1d10, on a 1 the horn explodes dealing 10d6 fire damage to the user and destroying the horn.

---

#### Horn of Valhalla

You can use a standard action to blow this horn. In response, 2d4+2 berserker warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear nearby. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use this horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

---

#### Ioun Stone

An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distant combination of shape and color.

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use a standard action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against it or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use a standard action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC/PD/MD 24, 10 hit points, and resistance 16+ to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

---

##### Awareness

---

#### Iron Bands of Bilarro

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use a standard action to speak the command word and throw a sphere at a huge or smaller creature nearby. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll. On a hit the target is stuck until you take a quick action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature, include the one stuck, can use a standard action to make a DC 20 Endurance check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the stuck creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until you gain a full recovery.

---

#### [Knave's Eye Patch](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:knaves-eye-patch)

---

#### [Mirror of the Past](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:mirror-of-the-past)

---

#### [Portable Hole](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:portable-hole)

---

#### Rope of Entangling

Fifty feet of fine, spidersilk rope, woven so closely that it seems like a solid, flexible cable. Once you attune the rope during a full heal-up, you can make it entangle things with standard action commands. In combat, it's not that useful, because it's slow compared to a living thing. If the target is stationary, however, the rope excels at reaching, climbing, snaking, coiling, and entangling. You might be able to get the rope to bind a ferocious monster, but the rope is likely to get destroyed in the process.

**Quirk:** Speaks in sentences for which "convoluted" is the only proper term.

---

### Epic

#### Absorbing Tattoo

While the tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance 16+ to a type of damage associated with the tattoo's color, as shown in the table below. The color is determined randomly.

| d10 | Damage Type | Color |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Acid | Green |
| 2 | Cold | Blue |
| 3 | Fire | Red |
| 4 | Force | White |
| 5 | Lightning | Yellow |
| 6 | Negative Energy | Black |
| 7 | Poison | Violet |
| 8 | Psychic | Silver |
| 9 | Positive Energy | Gold |
| 10 | Thunder | Orange |

When you take damage of the chosen type, you can use an interrupt action to gain immunity to that instance of the damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken. Once this reaction is used, it can't be used again until you gain a full recovery.

---

#### Battle Standard of Infernal Power

This hell-forged battle standard is made of infernal iron and fitted with a small, unopenable cage containing a quasit. The trapped quasit is incapacitated, and its cage has AC 19, 10 bit points, and immunity to all types of damage except force damage. If killed or somehow released, the quasit disappears in a cloud of smoke, and a new one appears in the cage, provided the cage is intact.

While you hold the banner, your melee and ranged attacks and those of all allied creatures in the same battle as you count as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage immunities and resistances.

---

#### Blood Fury Tattoo

Once per battle when you hit a creature with a weapon attack you can deal an extra 4d6 negative energy damage and regain half as much negative energy damage dealt.

---

#### Carpet of Flying

You can speak the carpet's command word as an action to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are nearby of it. A carpet can carry up to 800 lbs, but can only fly quickly while carrying less than 400 lbs.

---

#### Crystal Ball

A Crystal Ball is about 6 inches in diameter and while touching it you can cast the [Scrying Ritual](../Character-Rules/Rituals.md#scrying) without requiring components and a +10 on skill checks made for the ritual. While scrying with the crystal ball you have truesight within the scry.

---

#### Deck of Many Things

Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.

Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

**Balance** Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful become chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.

**Comet** Your party gains a miraculous campaign success.

**Donjon** You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.

**Euryale** The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.

**The Fates** Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

**Flames** A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

**Fool** Your party suffers a campaign loss, discard this card, and draw from the deck again.

**Gem** Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.

**Idiot** Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

**Jester** You gain a major campaign success, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

**Key** A Champion or Epic magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.

**Knight** You gain the service of a 2nd-level fighter who appears nearby you. The fighter is of the same species as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.

**Moon** You are granted the ability to cast the [Wish](../Classes/Wizard.md#wish) spell 1d3 times.

**Rogue** A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a [Wish](../Classes/Wizard.md#wish) spell can end the NPC's hostility toward you.

**Ruin** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.

**Skull** You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears nearby you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.

**Sun** You gain a miracle and complete your current adventure, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.

**Vizier** At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.

**The Void** This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A [Wish](../Classes/Wizard.md#wish) spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.

#### Ioun Stone

An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distant combination of shape and color.

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use a standard action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against it or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use a standard action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC/PD/MD 24, 10 hit points, and resistance 16+ to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

---

##### Absorption

#### Sphere of Annihilation

This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it. The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it.

The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are nearby an uncontrolled sphere you can use a standard action to make a DC 25 Arcana skill check. On a success the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, and moves closer to you on a failure.

If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control you make an Arcana skill check contested with the other creatures' Arcana.

If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal the GM rolls a d100 on the table below.

| d100 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 01-50 | The sphere is destroyed. |
| 51-85 | The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space. |
| 86-100 | A spatial rift sends each creature within a 1 mile area into a random plane of existence. |

## Chuul Symbiote Magic Items

_**Quirks:**_ Chuul-derived items are symbiotic, weaving their flesh with the flesh of their wielder. Instead of affecting the personality of the wielder, their quirk is that they warp the wielder's body in minor yet often disturbing ways. Over-attuning causes obviously monstrous mutations that are hard to hide.

_**Chuulish Recharge:**_ Chuulish items draw life energy and vital essences directly from their hosts. Any chuul-derived item that has a recharge has the following _chuulish recharge_ rule.

The item has a recharge roll like normal magic items, but it's easier to recharge it if the user is willing to use their own life force to help. These items recharge normally on 16+, or on 11+ for a cumulative –1 penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up, or on 6+ for a cumulative –2 penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up, or recharge without a roll for a cumulative –3 penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up.

## Cursed Magic Items

Cursed items can be useful, though all of them have significant drawbacks.

### _Shadow Dragons_

Players will often find cursed items such as these when approaching a Shadow Dragon lair. However, detecting the curse on any of these cursed items requires a DC 35 Intelligence check:
