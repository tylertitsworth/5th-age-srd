## Magic Item Descriptions

Each name/characteristic includes its action type, usage, description, power, and quirk (as applying to the item's user), if applicable. Magic items in the adventurer tier can be used by players in any tier. Magic items in the champion tier cannot be used by players in the adventurer tier. Epic level magic items are limited to epic-tier players.

### Arrow, Crossbow Bolt, Slingstone

In general, ammunition is one-use, hit or miss. It also doesn't take up a chakra, and, like other one-use items, ammunition doesn't confer quirks on its user.

#### Default Bonus

Expands crit range by 1 (adventurer, champion, and epic tier, always a 1-point expansion rather than 1 point per tier). Ammunition takes the bonus of the weapon that shoots it, just like mundane ammunition does.

#### Adventurer

##### Energy

This ammunition has been enchanted with one of the following types of energy: acid, cold, fire, holy, lightning, thunder. An attack using this ammunition deals that type of damage.

##### Forceful Impact

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, the target also pops free from each enemy engaged with it.

##### Keen

When you make an attack with this ammunition, the crit range of that attack expands by 1 (usually 18+ including the default bonus).

##### Lethal Strike

You deal +1d10 damage on a hit (champion: +2d10; epic: +4d10).

##### Lucky Stray

On a miss, you can make a basic ranged attack against another foe that is near the target or along your line of sight to the target (between you and the original target or past the original target).

##### Nemesis

This ammunition has been enchanted against one of the following groups of monsters: dragon, giant, orc, or undead. An attack against the designated nemesis with this ammunition can be rerolled once if it misses. When you use this ammunition, however, it allows each monster of the same group to reroll one attack against you that misses this battle. If you use this type of ammunition two or more times against the same creature group this battle, monsters of that type can instead reroll each attack against you that misses this battle (once per attack).

##### Seeking

You deal +4 damage on a miss (champion: +10; epic: +25).

##### Twin

When you attack with twin ammunition, a second projectile materializes out of the first and targets the same or a different enemy. Make a free action basic ranged attack for it with a +8 attack bonus instead of your normal bonus (champion: +12; epic: +16).

##### Vulnerability

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, if the target is from the same tier or lower than the ammunition, it's also vulnerable to all attacks until the start of your next turn.

##### Wing-clipper

When you hit with an attack using this ammunition, if the target is from the same tier or lower than the ammunition, it loses the _flight_ ability (save ends). If the target is presently flying, it must attempt to land during its next turn.

#### Champion

##### Flaming

Bursts into fire as it flies. You deal 8 extra ongoing fire damage on a hit (epic: 20 ongoing fire).

#### Epic

##### Death

When you hit with this ammunition and deal damage, if the target has 40 hp or fewer after the hit, the creature drops to 0 hp. If it hits but fails to drop its target, the ammunition is not used up. It must of course be retrieved.

##### Uncanny

It warps the forces of necessity and miracle as it flies. When you attack with this ammunition, use the target's lowest defense instead of the defense your attack would normally target.

### Armor, Robe, Shirt, Tunic

Most magic armor powers can apply to heavy armor, light armor, or even no armor (robes or other clothing).

#### Default Bonus

#### Optional Default Bonus

Drink a potion stored on this belt as a quick action instead of a standard action. (It also provides slots for up to six potions.) Quirk: Constantly attempts to refill everyone else's drinks. Or potions. Or ration bags.

##### Resilience

(Recharge 16+)

(Recharge 16+)

When you cast a divine spell, heal using a recovery and add +1d6 hit points to the total (champion: +2d8 hp; epic: +4d10 hp). Quirk: Sees the hands of the gods operating subtly through the natural and social world, and makes others aware of it.

Non-monks generally don't benefit from bracers.

Quirk: Writes with both hands at the same time on different parts of the page. It freaks people out.

##### Arcane Contact

These gloves improve your ability to contact, detect, and distinguish supernatural forces, provided you can touch some material object connected to a force. If, for example, you are improvising a ritual to gain a vision related to the scary artifact you just found, touching the artifact will help. The benefit is modest, determined by the GM, and possibly secret. The gloves provide no protection against the supernatural forces that touching an artifact might usher into your soul. Quirk: Always cracks knuckles.

##### Archer's Gauntlets

When you cast a divine spell, allow one nearby ally to roll a save against one ongoing save ends effect as a free action. Quirk: Alternately paranoid that people are looking too closely at your precious jeweled glove and upset that people aren't paying enough attention to your amazing jeweled glove.

(Recharge 6+): When your turn starts, roll a save against one ongoing save ends effect. Quirk: Favors traditional battle hymns.

##### Skullcap of Wit

You can banter with a lively wit. If you already have a lively wit, it doesn't make much of a difference. Interpret this ability narrowly enough that it might provide a bonus to a die roll that anyone really cares about only once in a campaign. Quirk: Banters with lively wit.

#### Epic

##### Crown of the Mighty Strike

(Recharge 16+)

This slim but elegant crown wants to share your glory and thus needs you to be glorious. It continually presses you to take bold actions.

The stones in the necklace breathe, ever so slightly. You gain a +5 bonus to death saves, if failure would kill you. You also gain a +5 bonus to last gasp saves. Quirk: Chides others for taking risks when they have lesser magical protection.

##### Momentous Harmony

The pendant brings out the best in other magic items you carry, so that their quirks turn more positive, or at least become weaker if they cause trouble. If you go over your magic item limit, the pendant ceases to function (including the default bonus) and the formerly subdued magic items express themselves with renewed fervor. Quirk: Treats all their magic items well—talks to them as if they're alive, refers to them as "children," etc.

##### Paragon

(Recharge 16+)

This necklace changes shape and jewels depending on the race of the wearer. When you use this necklace, you gain another use of your racial power in the battle.

##### Glory

This brilliant, gem-encrusted ring gives you an aura of status (and whatever that entails). Everyone can see it, even if they don't know why. Quirk: Becomes more and more obsessed with the idea that all their accomplishments are undeserved and that they themselves are frauds. This obsession often drives them to heroic acts.

##### Instant Vengeance

(Recharge 16+)

When you take damage from an enemy's attack, choose one ally you can see. That ally can make a basic attack (melee or ranged) against the attacker as a free action. Quirk: Sticks close to their friends, real close.

##### Iron Grip

When you make a skill check involving climbing, holding something, or otherwise using your hands to grip things, you can use +10 as your bonus in place of your normal bonus (level + ability mod + background; other magic item bonuses still count) (champion: +15; epic: +20). Quirk: Loves to arm wrestle, thumb wrestle, drum fingers on tables, etc.

##### Jack of All Trades

When you make a skill check, if your background bonus for that check is +1 or +0, you gain a +2 bonus for your background bonus instead (if your bonus is +2 or higher, this ring has no effect). Quirk: Talks as though they know everything.

##### Thief's-Eye

While the ring is on your finger, if you shut both eyes and concentrate, you can see through the ring, allowing you to peer around corners and such. Quirk: You're always prying into things that should maybe be left shut; doors, topics of conversation, taboos….

##### Wild Heart

Animals accept you and may even show you affection. The animals, however, still react normally if you threaten them, and well-trained guard animals are especially wary of you. Quirk: Seems out of place in civilization.

### Shield

#### Default Bonus

Increase your maximum hit points: by +4 (adventurer); by +10 (champion); by +25 (epic).

On a hit, the attack deals 2d6 damage; on a miss, it deals 2 damage (champion: 4d8 damage, or 5 on a miss; epic: 8d10 damage, or 12 on miss). Quirk: Compares everything to dragons or to draconic things, and judges actions by how they stack up to draconic expectations.

### Symbol, Holy Symbol, Relic, Sacred Branch

You can attune multiple wondrous items. They don't fill up a chakra.

#### Default Bonus

None.

#### Lore Bottle

A bottle of translucent glass, sealed with lead, with a ghastly face that peers out at you. When you ask it questions, it answers in the form of vague hunches. For tough questions, the face might fade out for a while, apparently searching somewhere for an answer. Owning the bottle gives you +2 bonus to Intelligence-based skill checks, if you have the time (and privacy) to consult the lore bottle. Chances are, your particular lore bottle has some sort of specialty or bias, which you will discover only through use. Unlike most magic items, lore bottles can often be found for sale, but you probably don't want those. Quirk: The connection formed with the face in the bottle can be compelling and unsettling, as the spirit literally "gets in your head." Each bottle has a different effect on its owner.

#### Dwarven Mug

One in four mugs of ale you drink from this mug will be magically transformed into the very finest non-magical dwarven ale. If your relationship with the mug is good, the variety might even suit your current mood and the odds of getting a good brew might improve in your favor. But really, who's going to complain about putting down a second, or even third, mug for the chance to get a taste of the best stuff? When that excellent ale does show up, you can share a sip or two with a friend, but other attempts to capitalize on this mug's magic will just shut it down until it can find a more suitable owner. Quirk: Speaks in dwarven, especially while drunk, even if ordinarily unable to speak dwarven.

#### Rope of Entangling

Fifty feet of fine, spidersilk rope, woven so closely that it seems like a solid, flexible cable. Once you attune the rope during a full heal-up, you can make it entangle things with standard action commands. In combat, it's not that useful, because it's slow compared to a living thing. If the target is stationary, however, the rope excels at reaching, climbing, snaking, coiling, and entangling. You might be able to get the rope to bind a ferocious monster, but the rope is likely to get destroyed in the process. Quirk: Speaks in sentences for which "convoluted" is the only proper term.

### Chuul Symbiote Magic Items

_ **Quirks:** _ Chuul-derived items are symbiotic, weaving their flesh with the flesh of their wielder. Instead of affecting the personality of the wielder, their quirk is that they warp the wielder's body in minor yet often disturbing ways. Over-attuning causes obviously monstrous mutations that are hard to hide.

_ **Chuulish Recharge:** _ Chuulish items draw life energy and vital essences directly from their hosts. Any chuul-derived item that has a recharge has the following _chuulish recharge_ rule.

The item has a recharge roll like normal magic items, but it's easier to recharge it if the user is willing to use their own life force to help. These items recharge normally on 16+, or on 11+ for a cumulative –1 penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up, or on 6+ for a cumulative –2 penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up, or recharge without a roll for a cumulative –3 penalty to all saves until the next full heal-up.

#### Chitin Claw

(ring)

This fleshy multi-eyed loop sheaths a finger in sharp carapace. _Always:_ When you pick a lock, disarm a trap, or otherwise perform a task that having a tiny shape-changing blade and tiny eyes attached to your finger would be aided by, you gain a +2 bonus to the roll. _Quirk:_ Gnarled over-long fingers on that hand.

The many eyes and symbiotic nervous system in this torso armor give you warning of danger. _Always:_ +1 AC (adventurer); +2 AC (champion); +3 AC (epic). _Chuulish recharge:_ You gain a +4 bonus to all defenses against ranged attacks until the end of the battle. _Quirk:_ Over-large protruding ribs.

#### Clawed Tentacles

(gloves)

These claw-covered tentacles normally reside under the skin of the forearm, completely concealed. _Chuulish recharge:_ Choose an enemy engaged with you. Until the end of the battle, whenever that enemy tries to disengage from you or pop free from you, it must first succeed at an easy save (champion: normal save; epic: hard save). _Quirk:_ Tentacles writhe in and out of the skin unexpectedly.

#### Death Claw

(gloves)

A lobster-clawed gauntlet that fits over your forearm. The eyes at the fleshy joints blink unnervingly. _Chuulish recharge:_ Reroll a missed melee attack with a +1 attack bonus (champion: +2; epic: +3). _Quirk:_ The claw flexes and snaps reflexively when wearer is excited.

#### Evil Eyes

(gloves)

This gauntlet has eyes on the knuckles, aiding archers and spellcasters. _Always:_ Bonus to attacks and damage with ranged attacks: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion); +3 (epic). The bonus doesn't stack with bonuses from magic weapons or implements. _Chuulish recharge:_ Until the end of the battle or for five minutes, you can see the unseen. Invisible creatures are visible to you, and you spot illusions for what they are. _Quirk:_ Bone ridges and oddly patterned callouses on the arms.

#### Glandular Parasite

(cloak/mantle

The parasite sits along your spine, feeding off your life force but also dampening your reactions to extreme stimuli and pain. _Always:_ +1 PD (adventurer); +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic). _Chuulish recharge:_ You are immune to fear effects until the end of the battle or for five minutes. _Quirk:_ Strangely pronounced spine.

#### Implanted Aventail

(light armor)

The symbiote is normally hidden. When commanded, a wave of small crab-like creatures pours out of concealed gill-like openings in your skin, providing you with scale-like armor. _Always:_ +1 AC (adventurer); +2 AC (champion); +3 AC (epic). Unleashing the armor is a quick action, and you retain the AC bonuses as long as it is in place. When the insects are retracted as a move action, you don't appear to be (or count as) wearing armor. _Quirk:_ Gill-like slits cover body even when the armor is not up.

#### Neural Blade

(any bladed weapon)

A boney blade with a spine and brain. _Always:_ Bonus to attacks and damage: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion); +3 (epic); and the weapon deals psychic damage. _Chuulish recharge:_ Choose a nearby enemy.

#### Neural Whip

(light one-handed melee weapon)

A tentacle snakes one end around your arm, inserting filaments beneath the skin. The whip stretches and flexes at your mental command, the tip studded with hardened pulsing nerves. _Always:_ Bonus to attacks and damage: +1 (adventurer); +2 (champion); +3 (epic). _2/battle:_ You can use a reach trick with the whip (_13__th_ _Age_ core book, page 44), and the attack deals psychic damage. _Quirk:_ Grows eyes in unusual places.

#### Rachis Girdle

(belt)

The pulsating band of chuul-flesh inside a bony cage sits on your lower back, exchanging blood and injecting substances into your organs. _Always:_ Increase your maximum hp by +4 (champion: +10 hp; epic: +25 hp). Whenever you take ongoing damage, reduce that damage by your level. _Quirk:_ Odd gait from reconfigured pelvis.

#### Rasping Greaves

(boots)

A carapace covers each of your legs and has an unblinking armored eye on the knee. Unfolding blade-like appendages whip out at those engaged with you. _Always:_ When you make an opportunity attack, the target takes +1d6 extra damage on a hit (champion: +2d8; epic: +4d10). _Quirk:_ A billow-like lung inside each greave makes a breathing sound.

#### Strider Symbiote

(cloak/mantle – champion tier item)

This living "backpack" clings to you with tentacles and inserts mouthparts into the top of your spine. The segmented limbs of the strider usually lie flat against your body but may be commanded to spring out and carry you like a long-legged spider. _Always:_ +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic). _Chuulish recharge:_ Until the end of the battle or for five minutes, you can move on walls or ceilings as easily as you do across the ground. (epic: chuulish recharge starts at 11+) _Quirk:_ Twitching antenna.

#### Xenoteros

(cloak/mantle)

Insectile wings hide in slits under the always itching skin of your back. _Always:_ +1 PD (adventurer); +2 PD (champion); +3 PD (epic). _Chuulish recharge:_ As a standard action, you can fly clumsily for one round (champion: 1d3 + 1 rounds; epic: 2d4 rounds). _Quirk:_ Insectile mouthparts grow at the back of the throat and squiggle out when wearer talks excitedly.

### Cursed Magic Items

Cursed items can be useful, though all of them have significant drawbacks.

_Shadow Dragons_

Players will often find cursed items such as these when approaching a Shadow Dragon lair. However, detecting the curse on any of these cursed items requires a DC 35 Intelligence check:

**30 or less:** Nothing seems to be wrong.

**31–34:** Something isn't right about the item. It could be cursed, or just has a bad quirk.

**35+ or natural 20:** The item is cursed!

**Natural roll is 1–5:** The creature attempting to discern the item's magic accidentally attunes to the cursed item!

#### General

##### Dancing Shoes

(boots)

Shiny red shoes with golden wings. _Always:_ The shoes force you to dance whenever you hear music (even off-key whistling will work). The shoes magically re-appear on your feet if taken off for more than 10 minutes. _Recharge 6+:_ You gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks until the end of the battle (or five minutes).

##### Deck of Many Cards

(wondrous item)

A divination deck. _Always:_ The deck of cards continually grows, and you find your pockets and pouches filling with cards that spill out leaving a trail for anyone to follow. Occasionally, the cards spill out in a prophetic pattern that might have meaning to the owner or an ally.

##### Disappointment Hat

(hat)

Green conical hat. _Always:_ Each time you cast a spell outside of combat or a spell is cast near you, it has some side effect (GM's choice) that inconveniences you. _Recharge 6+:_ As a move action you pull out an item from the hat. Roll a d6 to see what you get: 1–2: You get a useless or disgusting item. 3–6: You pull a useful non-magical item that grants a +d6 bonus to your next skill check until the end of your next turn.

##### Girdle of Gender Switching

(belt)

Wide leather belt with acorn designs. _Always:_ Increase your total recoveries by one, but your gender is switched. Removing the belt reverses the effect but it teleports back onto you if removed for more than 10 minutes. In addition, minor shifts in weight distribution throw your balance off, and you take a –1 penalty with melee attacks during your first battle each day.

##### Tome of Misfortune

(implement)

Book with an embossed face inside its cover. _1/day:_ Regain one expended daily spell that you have cast. When you cast the recovered spell, roll a d6. 1–3: The book chooses the targets for the spell and can consider you and your allies as enemies, or your enemies as allies. 4–6: You choose targets normally.

##### Treasured Chest

(wondrous item)

It follows you on little feet, obeys you, and is much larger on the inside (able to hold the same amount of stuff as a large closet). _Always:_ You can't move faster than the chest, and the chest is slow.

(staff)

A glowing rod that expands into a longer pole. _Always:_ Bonus to attacks and damage: +2 (adventurer). In addition, if you are a rogue with the _swashbuckle_ ability, you gain an extra use of that ability, but whenever you roll a natural 1 or 2 with any d20 roll, the staff flings you into danger (you take 2d6 damage and possibly provoke opportunity attacks in battle).

##### Anger Armor

(heavy armor)

Platemail or similar with leering faces on the pauldrons. _Always:_ +2 AC (adventurer). In addition, when you miss with an attack and the escalation die is odd, roll a save; on a failure, you are enraged until the start of your next turn and take a –4 penalty to all defenses.
