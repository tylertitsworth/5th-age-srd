# Animal Companion Rules

You have a devoted animal companion who fights alongside you like a member of your adventuring party.

If you have a single talent invested into Animal Companion, you are an Animal Companion initiate. If you invested two talents into Animal Companion, you are an Animal Companion adept.

These are the same rules as for the druid.

## Calling to Battle

When you roll initiative, you may choose whether you want your animal companion to take part in the battle. You may also call your animal companion during the battle with a quick action.

Animal Companion initiates may only call their animal companion once every other battle. The animal companion may not fight in two battles in a row—even between full heal-ups, adventures, or gaining new levels. Animal Companion adepts don't have this limitation; their animal companion can fight in every battle if the adept so chooses.

## Recoveries

As an initiate, add a recovery to your total recoveries. As an adept, add two recoveries to your total recoveries. You can use a recovery on yourself or your animal companion.

## Actions

Your animal companion acts on your initiative turn, either immediately before or after you, depending on the animal type.

Your animal companion moves gets a move action and a standard action, but not a quick action.

If you have powers that care about the "first time you attack an enemy," an attack by your animal companion counts as your attack.

## Animal Harm

Your animal companion can be healed like an ally. If it gets healed without you being healed, it uses one of your recoveries. When you use a recovery while next to your animal companion (including being engaged with the same enemy), your animal companion is also healed using a free recovery.

Instead of dying like a monster or NPC at 0 hp, your animal companion follows PC rules for falling unconscious at 0 hp and dying after four failed death saves or when its negative hit points equal half its normal hit points. If your animal companion dies, it's gone for the battle, though you can call it (or another one) to fight in the next battle (as an adept) or the in the battle after that (as an initiate). That animal companion will be one level lower than an animal companion would normally be, i.e. two levels below you. At the start of the next battle, bump the animal companion up to its proper level, i.e. one below you.

## Stats & Levels

Each animal companion has roughly the same base stats as listed below.

Your animal companion is always one level lower than you. As a 1st level ranger, you'll have a level 0 animal companion. Once you gain a level, your animal companion rises to 1st level.

On top of the base stats, each type of animal has a zoologically appropriate power or advantage.

## Companion Bonuses

Each type of animal companion is a little different.

## Animated Plant

**Acts:** After druid / ranger

Advantage: With a successful easy difficulty skill check (using your ability scores and backgrounds), your companion can disguise itself as a mundane plant. It is also vulnerable to fire.

### Adventurer Feat

On a natural even hit with a melee attack, your companion gives enemies disadvantage on checks to disengage from it until the end of your next turn.

## Bear (also Giant Badger, Wolverine)

**Acts:** After druid / ranger

**Advantage:** The bear gains temporary hit points equal to its level each time it hits with an attack.

## Champion Feat

The temporary hit points increase to double its level.

## Boar (also Spiky Lizard)

**Acts:** Before druid / ranger

**Advantage:** The boar gains a +1 attack bonus when it moves before its attack during the same turn.

## Eagle (also Falcon, Hawk, Owl, Vulture)

Advantage: Once per battle, your companion can teleport to a nearby location it can see as a move action.

## Giant Toad

**Acts:** After druid / ranger

**Advantage:** The wolf gains a +1 attack bonus against enemies its master attacked the same turn, or against enemies engaged with its master.

## Baseline Stats

Use the following stats as the baseline for your animal companion. Remember that your companion stays a level lower than you. Generally your companion's Physical Defense should be higher than its Mental Defense, but you could flip that if you have a good explanation.

| **Level** | **Attack** | **Damage** | **AC** | **PD (or MD)** | **MD (or PD)** | **HP** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | +5 vs. AC | d8 | 16 | 14 | 10 | 20 (10) |
| 1 | +6 vs. AC | d10 | 17 | 15 | 11 | 27 (13) |
| 2 | +7 vs. AC | 2d6 | 18 | 16 | 12 | 36 (18) |
| 3 | +9 vs. AC | 3d6 | 19 | 17 | 13 | 45 (22) |

## Animal Companion Feats

Animal companion feats are designed so that they do not build on each other. Unlike other feats, you don't have to take animal companion feats progressively, one after the other as long as you qualify for the correct tier.

## Adventurer Feats

- Once per full recovery, your animal companion can attack twice in a round with a standard action.
- Once per battle, your animal companion can turn a disengage success by an enemy it is engaged with into a failure.
- Once per full recovery, reroll one of your animal companion's missed attack rolls.
- Your animal companion adds the escalation die to its attacks.

## Champion Feats

- Once per full recovery, your animal companion can force an enemy to reroll an attack that hit it.
- Your Lethal Hunter talent also applies to your animal companion.
- Increase your animal companion's Physical Defense and Mental Defense by +1.

## Epic Feats

- Increase your animal companion's damage die by one size (for example, from d6s to d8s, or d8s to d10s).
- Increase your animal companion's AC by +1.

## Animal Companion Spells

As an Animal Companion adept, you gain a number of spells to help your animal companion—or another's—fight better. You don't have to choose the spells you know ahead of time. You can cast any spell of your level or lower, limited only by the number of full recovery spells you get. Once you cast a particular full recovery spell, no matter its level, you can't cast it again until you take your next full heal-up.

Animal Companion spells are not available to Animal Companion initiates.

### Spirit Guardian

Ranged spell

Free action to cast

Full Recovery

**Special Trigger:** You drop to 0 hp or below while your animal companion is nearby and still above 0 hp.

**Effect:** Your spirit trades places with the spirit of your animal companion. You now occupy the body of your animal companion, using its current hit points, defenses, and attacks (and the effects of any spells cast upon it earlier).

You can't cast spells or use your normal humanoid powers and class features while in your companion's body. You can either keep fighting as your animal companion or you can roll a normal save as a quick action once during each of your turns; if you succeed, your body and your animal companion's body swap places while your spirits return to their proper bodies. You keep the hit points of the animal companion before you rolled the save, but can heal using a recovery when the swap is complete, if you wish. Returning to your own partially-healed body thanks to the successful save ends the spell's effect.

While your animal companion is in your body, it can roll death saves and be healed. If it becomes conscious it can attack using its basic melee attacks, but it doesn't have access to any of your spells or powers. Any failed death saves remain with the spirit that failed them, not the body.
