# Retainers

Since your character is an adventurer, it's surprising that you have allies and less famous adventurers show up to help you out or even pledge their service. These are called retainers and they have similar rules to monsters, but with some exciting differences!

Retainers are more narrow in scope, so rather than being a 'Barbarian' or a 'Wizard' they are a *Blood Shaman* or a *Abjurationist*. Retainers are cool, but not cooler than the main cast of characters and often are much simpler characters that can be sent to troubleshoot tasks and be an advisor for tough situations.

## Abilities and Stats

A retainer has a basic attack they can use and a primary ability determined by their class association and level that can be used 3 times per full recovery. All retainers are associated with a given class, and you know that they are associated with this class because you can pick out powers that scale with their level that best associate with that character's personality and attack style. A retainer is always at least 1 level below your current level.

Retainers act on your intiative and get all the regular actions that PCs do.

After describing your retainer to your GM, they can generate stats for your retainer, here's an example of *Icarus, the Black King*:

| Icarus, the Black King | 1st Level |
| --- | --- |
| Medium | Retainer |
| Humanoid |Initiative: +6 |
| Immunities: Fire | Vulnerabilities: Cold |
| Claw +9 vs. AC: | 5 damage |
| Natural 18+: | Roll on the High Weirdness Table |
| Fiery Claw +9 vs. PD: | 10 fire damage, and the target loses any resist fire damage abilities if they have them (hard dc save ends 16+). |
| Limited Use (3/FR) |  |
| HP 37 | AC 17 |
| MD 15 | PD 11 |
