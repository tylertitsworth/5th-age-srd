# Rituals

Rituals are complex ceremonies that create magic effects. You don't memorize or prepare a ritual; a ritual is so long and complex that no one could ever commit the whole thing to memory. To perform a ritual, you need to read from a book or a scroll containing it. Clerics, Druids, and wizards learn ritual magic by default; other spellcasters can learn it by taking the Ritual Casting feat.

## Ritual Scroll

A ritual scroll contains a single ritual, and you can perform the ritual from that scroll only once. After that, the magic contained in the scroll is expended, and the scroll turns to dust. Anyone can use a ritual scroll to perform the ritual it contains, as long as the appropriate components are expended.

### Acquiring Ritual Scrolls

Like a ritual book, a ritual scroll can be purchased for the given market price. Ritual scrolls can also be found as treasure. You can create a ritual scroll by transcribing a ritual you have mastered. Creating a ritual scroll takes twice the amount of time as creating a ritual book but costs the same price.

Even though a ritual scroll lets you perform a ritual, you can neither master a ritual from a scroll nor copy a scroll into a ritual book. A scroll is a condensed version of a ritual, partially cast and primed so that it only takes up a single page.

## Ritual Book

You can buy ritual books or find them as treasure. You can also make a copy of an existing ritual book. When you explore a ruined library, delve into a lost temple, or do away with a villainous wizard, you might discover tomes on arcane philosophy that contain rituals. Such ritual books are part of the treasure you acquire while adventuring.

A ritual book contains one or more rituals that you can use as often and as many times as you like, as long as you can spare the time and the components to perform the ritual. When you copy a ritual into an existing book, you don't just write a series of words on each page; you bind some of the ritual's magic into the book. Therefore, you need a book of the highest quality, exotic inks, and expensive components, with a total cost equal to the ritual's market price. You don't save any gold by creating a ritual book instead of buying it.

Owning a ritual book isn't enough to let you perform the ritual or rituals in it. You must first master a ritual by studying it for 8 uninterrupted hours. (If you gained a ritual by creating its book yourself or by obtaining it as a class feature, you have already mastered it.)

You must meet two requirements to master a ritual. You must have Ritual magic or the Ritual casting feat, and your level must equal or exceed the ritual's level. If you meet those requirements and spend 8 hours studying a ritual, you can add it to your list of mastered rituals. As long as you have the ritual's book handy, you can perform a mastered ritual whenever you want.

There's no limit to the number of rituals you can master. If you copy a ritual that you haven't already mastered, the time you spend copying it enables you to master the ritual.

## Casting a Ritual

To cast a ritual that you have mastered, you spend a certain amount of time (specified in the ritual description) performing various actions appropriate to the ritual. The actions might include reading long passages out of the ritual book, scribing complex diagrams on the ground, burning special incense or sprinkling mystic reagents at appropriate times, or performing a long set of meticulous gestures. The specific activities required aren't described in most ritual descriptions; they're left to your imagination.

A ritual requires certain esoteric components, which you purchase before you perform the ritual and which are expended when the ritual is complete. Each ritual specifies the cost of the components you need. If a ritual requires a skill check, the check usually determines the ritual's effectiveness. Even if the check result is low, a ritual usually succeeds, but if the result is high, you can usually achieve better effects.

### Ritual Scroll

Using a Ritual Scroll: A ritual scroll holds one use of a particular ritual. You can perform a scroll's ritual even if you don't have the Ritual Caster feat, regardless of the level of the ritual. You still have to expend the components and supply any focus required by the ritual, and you can enlist your allies' assistance. Once you have finished performing the ritual on a scroll, the scroll turns to dust. If the ritual is interrupted, the scroll remains intact.

Casting a ritual from a scroll takes half the time indicated in a ritual's description, since the creation of the scroll has primed the magic.

### Assissting a Ritual

Unless a ritual specifies otherwise, up to four of your allies can help you perform a ritual. Everyone assisting you must be nearby, and each assistant must actively participate in the ritual for the entire time required to complete it. Your assistants need neither the Ritual Caster feat nor knowledge of the specific ritual. Your allies can assist you in two ways.

- If the ritual requires spending recoveries or some other resource, willing allies can contribute those resources.
- Your allies can assist with the skill check you make to complete a ritual, using the normal rules for cooperating on another character's skill check.

>_Note_: Certain rituals might allow unwilling participants to pay those costs as well, but such rituals involve sacrifices to malevolent gods or demon lords and are not found in the ritual books of most player characters.

### Interrupting a Ritual

At any time before a ritual is completed, you can stop it and suffer no ill effect. You don't expend any components or pay any costs until a ritual is completed. You can't resume a ritual that was interrupted, however, so you do lose the time you spent on an interrupted ritual.

## Level 1 Rituals

### Generic Rituals

#### Brew Potion

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Permanent until consumed

**Market/Component Cost**: 25 gp/Special

**Effect**: You create a common potion or elixir of your level or lower. The ritual's component cost is equal to the price of the potion or elixir you create.

#### Purify Water

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp

**Effect**: You purify a volume of water.

**Skill Check**: The amount of water you can purify is determined by the result of your Nature Check.

| Nature Skill Check Result | Volume of Water Purified | Example Equivalent |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 9 or lower | 5 Liters | Blood in Human Body |
| 10-19 | 250 Liters | Bathtub |
| 20-29 | 1,000 Liters | 5x5x5 ft. Cube |
| 30 or higher | 1,000,000 Liters | Olympic Swimming Pool |

### Arcane Rituals

#### Alarm

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/8 hours or until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp; plus a set of focuses

**Effect**: You ward the nearby area, and designate a spoken password that allows a creature to enter the warded area without triggering an alarm. This alarm can send a mental signal to you or make an audible ringing sound.

If a Tiny or larger creature enters the warded area without speaking the password, the alarm you set triggers, and the ritual is discharged. However, an insubstantial creature or any creature that succeeds on a Stealth check (DC 10 + your Arcana skill check modifier) does not trigger the alarm.

The result of triggering the alarm depends on the type of alarm. When an audible alarm triggers, all creatures in the warded area that are capable of hearing can hear the ringing. If they are sleeping, the noise awakens them. When a mental alarm triggers, a mental ping alerts you of the intrusion and awakens you from sleep. In either case, the alarm informs you where the warded area was breached.

_Focus_: While holding a tiny bell (5 gp), you use a fine silver wire (5 gp) to scribe runes on the warded area's perimeter.

#### Amanuensis

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp

**Effect**: You capture the writing from one source (a book, scroll, or tablet) and cause it to appear onto a special prepared paper, parchment, book, or some other similar item. This ritual copies up to 250 words of text, enough to fill one page with text. A copied illustration counts as a number of words proportional to the amount of the page the illustration requires.

This ritual can be used to copy a ritual scroll, even if you have not mastered the ritual on the original scroll. Creating a ritual scroll in this manner takes twice as long as creating a ritual book but has the same cost (in addition to the component cost of this ritual).

#### Arcane Mark

**Casting Time/Duration**: 5 minutes/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp

**Effect**: You set your personal arcane mark on an object. It manifests as a unique sigil of your devising.

Using this ritual on a language you have seen as a piece of writing allows you to read the language for the next 24 hours and, if your Arcana skill check result is 25 or higher, to write the language in its native script or in any other script you know for the duration.

Using this ritual on a language you have both heard and seen as a piece of writing within the past 24 hours allows you to understand it in both forms for the next 24 hours, and an Arcana skill check result of 25 or higher allows you to speak and write the language.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines how well you understand the language or writing.

Each light can fly. Whenever you use a move action to move, you can move all the lights as part of that action. You can also use a quick action to move all your lights. You must have line of effect to a light to move it. Any light goes out if it becomes far away from you at the end of your turn.

#### Eye of Alarm

**Casting Time/Duration**: 30 minutes/24 hours (special)

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines how many eyes you can place and what type of vision or sensory ability they possess.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Eyes Created | Vision/Sensory Ability |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 14 or lower | 1 | Normal Vision |
| 15-24 | 3 | Darkvision |
| 25 or higher | 5 | Darkvision and Tremorsense |

The eyes do not hear, but they see well. Each uses your Perception modifier, with a +5 bonus.

If an eye sees an intruder, it emits a loud warning sound defined by you during the ritual. This sound could be anything from a stentorian “Enemies approach!” to an owl's screech to a fanfare of trumpets. The Perception DC to hear the eye's sound is 0 (modified by distance as normal).

The eyes never consider you an intruder. In addition, you can designate any number of other ritual participants as nonintruders. When you perform the ritual, you can also designate one or more categories of creatures that the eyes will ignore. You can define these categories by obvious physical characteristics (such as height, weight, or body shape), creature type (such as humanoid), creature race (such as hill giant), or obvious equipment (such as a creature carrying a shield with a flame emblazoned upon it).

The ritual's effects last for 24 hours or until you move far away from all the eyes.

_Optional Focus_: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by using a focus of a small, jeweled eye made of silver and ruby, worth 100 gp.

#### Secret Page

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp

**Effect**: You ward writings so others cannot read them. Use of this ritual protects one page (maximum 250 words). You make the page appear not to exist, causing anyone other than you to ignore it; the page's presence is blocked from a reader's mind. You can choose instead to obscure the page with false writings, which you produce before performing the ritual. Other readers see the false text rather than the real text.

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp

**Effect**: You create an illusion of an object or a creature, or an effect such as fire. This illusion has only a visual aspect. A creature can use a quick action to make an Arcana skill check or a Perception skill check (DC 10 + your Arcana skill check modifier) when it sees the illusion. If the check succeeds, the creature discerns the illusory nature of the image. If a creature interacts with the illusion, the illusory nature of the image is immediately apparent, and the ritual is discharged.

It remains stationary unless you move far away from it, in which case it moves with your base speed once per round until it is nearby you. You can command the disk to move up to your speed as a move action. If you are far away from the disk for 2 consecutive rounds, the disk disappears, dropping whatever it was carrying.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check result determines the maximum load the disk can carry.

An unseen servant never tires. It cannot move far away from you. It does not occupy any space and cannot attack or be attacked. Each unseen servant you currently control doubles the component cost to create the next.

_Focus_: A ceramic hand. The person who holds this focus is empowered to command any unseen servants summoned with it. If the focus is broken or not in anyone's possession for a minute or longer, all unseen servants bound to it disappear.

#### Create Holy Water

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/24 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/Special

**Effect**: This ritual infuses astral radiance into a small quantity of ordinary water. The cost to do so depends on the level of the holy water you choose to create. You cannot create holy water of a level higher than your own. Aside from its effect on undead and demons, holy water acts as normal pure water in all ways. It can be distinguished from normal water with examination and a successful DC 15 Arcana skill check.

#### Gentle Repose

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp

#### Read Omens

**Casting Time/Duration**: 5 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/1 recovery and a focus

**Effect**: You can ask one question regarding a particular action, framing the question so that the answer tells you whether the chosen action will benefit or harm you or an ally. This ritual can see only about half an hour into the future, and it deals only with the immediate effects of taking a specific action. The ritual cannot deduce long-term consequences or predict the outcome of long-term actions.

Once you ask the question, the GM secretly rolls an Arcana skill check for you against a moderate DC. Your allies cannot aid you in making this check. If you try again to predict the outcome of the same action, the ritual supplies the same check result.

- Successful Check: The GM tells you that the intended action should bring one of these results.
- Weal—a good result, such as when the reward outweighs the risk.
- Woe—a bad result, such as when the risk outweighs the reward.
- Weal and Woe—both good and bad, such as when the reward is equal to the risk.
- Nothing—neither a good nor a bad result.
- Failed Check: As per “nothing” above. You can't tell if this “nothing” is due to a successful check or a failed check.

_Focus_: You drop a set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens (worth 50 gp) to read the answer to your query in their arrangement.

Once the ritual is complete, you whisper a message of up to 25 words to the animal and name a recipient and a location. The animal bounds off toward the location, in search of the recipient. The animal avoids danger along its path. Upon finding the recipient, the animal approaches until it is adjacent to the recipient, and then your whisper issues from the animal's mouth, conveying the message. When the animal delivers its message or the ritual's duration ends, your influence ends and the animal reverts to its natural behavior.

**Skill Check**: Your Nature skill check determines how long the animal is affected by the ritual.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Duration |
| -------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 6 hours |

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/8 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp

**Effect**: You summon hundreds of diminutive nature spirits to assemble a campsite around you. The spirits clear the area, set up tents, unroll bedrolls, gather water, and prepare a nourishing meal. They also conceal the campsite.

The spirits utilize your and your allies' gear to make the campsite. If you and your allies lack the appropriate gear, the spirits gather raw materials from the environment to make the campsite.

At the end of the ritual's duration, the spirits break down the campsite, pack up your gear, and restore the site to its original state, removing evidence that you and your allies camped there.

**Skill Check**: Your Nature skill check result serves as the DC for Perception checks to notice the hidden camp.

#### Dowsing Rod

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/12 hours or until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp

**Effect**: You transform a stick or other natural object into a dowsing rod. When you do so, name a natural feature of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, forests, or caves. The dowsing rod points the way to the nearest place that fits the description. You can't name a specific place, such as Mount Baneflame, and the rod can't find magically concealed locations. When you reach the destination, the ritual is discharged.

**Skill Check**: Your Nature skill check determines the bonus you and your allies gain and the penalty others take.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Bonus to Stealth | Penalty to Find Tracks |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 19 or lower | +2 | –2 |
| 20-29 | +5 | –5 |

## Level 2 Rituals

### Generic rituals

#### Find Traps

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp and 1 recovery

**Effect**: You gain an intuitive sense for traps in your surroundings, allowing you to make an Insight check to detect each trap nearby you. The DC for the check is the lowest detect DC the trap has.

### Arcane Rituals

#### Arcane Lock

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You lock a door, a window, a gate, a portcullis, or some other means of ingress. You can open the door normally, but those who don't have your permission to use it find it locked.

When you perform the ritual, you can allow for certain other creatures or types of creatures to pass through the door normally, ignoring the ward's effect. You can choose any or all (or none) of the following options:

_Password_: You can set a verbal password. If uttered within 5 squares of the portal, the speaker can ignore the ward for the next minute.

_Individuals_: You can designate up to ten other specific individuals who can ignore the ward at all times.

_Descriptions_: You can describe one or more categories of creatures who can ignore the ward at all times, using specific, observable characteristics such as species, type, size, or equipment carried or worn.

The Arcane Lock remains until you dismiss it, the door is destroyed, or until the ward is defeated, such as by the Knock ritual or a successful Strength or Sleight of Hand check. Wherever you are, you instantly know if your Arcane Lock is defeated by one of these methods.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check, with a +5 bonus, sets the DC for Sleight of Hand checks or Strength checks made to open the door.

#### Change Self

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/1 hour

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp and 1 recovery

**Effect**: You take on the appearance of a humanoid of your size. You can also alter the appearance of your clothing, armor, and equipment, all of which must remain present and maintain the same general shape. You retain your statistics in your new form. Creatures viewing or interacting with you can make an Insight check (DC 10 + your Arcana skill check modifier) to detect the deception.

_Ritual Scroll_: You can perform this ritual as a standard action if you do so from a scroll. If you do so, the ritual costs you 1 additional recovery, and the DC to see through the deception is 5 + your Arcana skill check modifier.

#### Deathly Shroud

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: When you complete this ritual, all creatures except for intelligent undead perceive you as undead. You are seen as having the undead type by any undead of Intelligence 9 or lower. Powers and wards that affect the undead type affect you as well.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 hour |
| 10-14 | 2 hours |
| 15-19 | 4 hours |
| 20-29 | 8 hours |
| 30 or higher | 24 hours |

#### Disenchant Magic Item

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: The ritual destroys a magic item of your tier or lower, and the item can be common, uncommon, or rare. The ritual returns an amount of residuum based on the item's rarity: 20 percent of a common item's gold piece value, 50 percent of an uncommon item's gold piece value, and 100 percent of a rare item's gold piece value.

#### Enchant Magic Item

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/Special

**Effect**: You touch a normal item and turn it into a magic item of your tier or lower. The ritual's component cost is equal to the price of the magic item you create. Alternatively, you can use the ritual to upgrade a common, uncommon, or rare item to a more powerful version of the item that is one tier higher. The new version must be your tier or lower, and the component cost equals the difference in gold piece value between the old version and the new.

You can also use this ritual to resize magic armor (for example, shrink a fire giant's magic armor to fit a halfling). There is no component cost for this use.

#### Excavation

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/1 minute

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You clear medium volume of earth and loose stone nearby you, leaving the start of a trench or a tunnel.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check result divided by 10 (rounded down) determines the number of volumes you clear. The material disappears over the course of the ritual's duration and is scattered across the world.

#### Knock

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp, plus 1 recovery

**Effect**: The Knock ritual allows you to open a single locked door, chest, gate, or other object. It even works against portals sealed with the Arcane Lock ritual or doors secured with bolts or bars that are on the far side, out of reach. You must defeat all the closures on a locked object to unlock it.

**Skill Check**: You make one Arcana skill check per lock, bar, Arcane Lock, or similar closure. The object you unlock does not open automatically; you still must open it yourself after the ritual unlocks it.

Your Arcana skill check has a +5 bonus in place of a Sleight of Hand check to open each lock or closure. To undo bolts or bars you normally couldn't reach, you must succeed on a DC 15 Arcana skill check.

If you use this ritual successfully against a portal protected by Arcane Lock, you destroy the Arcane Lock and its effects end.

#### Lesser Telepathy

**Casting Time/Duration**: 5 minutes/1 hour

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp and 1 recovery

**Effect**: You grant yourself telepathy. This telepathy can be used only to communicate to nearby allies.

#### Magic Circle

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Until broken

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You inscribe a circle on the ground, a circle emblazoned with arcane symbols of protection. If drawn correctly, these symbols make it difficult for creatures of a particular origin to enter or pass. When performing the ritual, you choose aberrant, elemental, fey, immortal, natural, shadow, or all. The last option applies a –5 penalty to your check. The circle requires 1 minute to inscribe per square inside the circle (and it must be a circle).

**Skill Check**: An affected creature whose level is lower than your Arcana skill check result minus 10 cannot pass through the circle, affect creatures through the circle's boundary, or affect the boundary in any way. Other creatures of an affected origin take force damage equal to your Arcana skill check result when passing through the boundary, but doing so breaks the circle. Unaffected creatures can take a standard action to obscure the inscription and break the circle.

#### Object Reading

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/5 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You see images you wish to see related to an object you hold at the completion of the ritual.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check result determines the number of images you see that are associated with the object's past. You might choose to see a sword's last owner, the creature that forged it, and the last creature it killed.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Number of Images |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 |
| 10-19 | 2 |
| 20-29 | 3 |
| 30 or higher | 5 |

#### Phantom Steeds

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/12 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: This ritual conjures forth up to eight horselike creatures. Each one is Large and can be ridden by you or any other character you designate during the ritual.

**SKill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines whether your steed has any special movement capabilities. The steeds have the special movement capabilities associated with your check result and all lower results.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Special Movement |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| 9 or lower | None |
| 10-19 | Ignore uneven terrain |
| 20-29 | Water Walk |
| 30 or higher | Fly low to the ground |

The steeds cannot attack or affect other creatures in any way other than to serve as mounts. Each steed's defense scores are equal to its rider's (or yours, if the steed has no rider). A phantom steed is immune to any effect other than damage.

A steed created by this ritual lasts for 12 hours or until it takes any damage. When the ritual ends, or when a steed is destroyed, the steed fades into nothingness and its rider lands on his or her feet in the steed's space. If a steed is flying when it disappears, the rider descends safely to the ground, landing at the start of his or her next turn.

#### Sending

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You convey a mental message of up to 25 words to a person you know. If the target is within range, he or she receives the message mentally and can respond likewise.

**Skill Check**: The ritual's maximum range is determined by your Arcana skill check result.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Maximum Range |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| 9 or lower | 10 miles |
| 10-19 | 100 miles |
| 20-29 | 500 miles |
| 30 or higher | anywhere on the same plane |

#### Shatter

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You can shatter all nonmagical objects composed of crystal, glass, ceramic, porcelain and similar fragile materials in a 2-square radius centered on you. An object heavier than 5 pounds, larger than Tiny, or more valuable than 25 gp is immune to this area effect.

You can instead focus the effect on one object of the proper composition. An object heavier than 50 pounds, larger than Medium, or more valuable than 250 gp is immune to this targeted effect.

_Ritual Scroll_: You can perform this ritual as a standard action when you do so from a scroll. If you do, the ritual affects a smaller area, and the GM makes a saving throw for each object in the area. On a save, the object is unaffected. If you use the targeted effect, the target gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw.

#### Shrink

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You shrink an object. Your Arcana skill check result determines how small the item becomes and how long the effect of the ritual lasts.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Size | Duration |
| ------------------- | ---- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 75% of true size | 1 hour |
| 10-19 | 50% of true size | 6 hours |
| 20-29 | 25% of true size | 12 hours |
| 30 or higher | 10% of true size | 24 hours |

#### Tongues

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/10 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp and a recovery

**Effect**: You or one ally present during the ritual's performance gains the ability to speak and understand all languages. Creatures that can hear the target understand what he or she says as if he or she were speaking their native language. If the target can hear another creature that is speaking a language, he or she understands what that creature says as if it were speaking the target's native language.

#### Undead Servitor

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You imbue a humanoid corpse of natural origin and Medium or smaller size with the ability to move under its own power and an understanding of one language of your choice. It never tires, and obeys you at all times.

The undead servitor is a noncombatant. When forced onto an active battlefield, treat the servitor as an allied mook (1 hit point, never damaged on a missed attack) with all defenses of 11. It acts just after you do and never makes attacks.

You cannot have more than one undead servitor at a time from different performances of this ritual. If you attempt to create a second servitor, that ritual fails without component expenditure.

#### Wizard's Escape

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/10 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: For the ritual's duration, you and up to eight allies can squeeze into and through spaces that a Tiny creature can squeeze through, allowing them to fit into crevices, under some doors, and through most barred gates or walls. An affected creature must still squeeze to fit into a space it could not normally enter. How this ritual manifests varies from caster to caster: It can allow creatures to squeeze their body as though boneless, to step through half-dimensions, ripple into and out of smaller shapes, or anything else.

### Divine Rituals

#### Cure Disease

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: The Cure Disease ritual wipes away a single disease afflicting the subject, whether the disease is active or still incubating. The subject is completely cured and loses any negative side effects and symptoms of the disease.

This ritual is physically taxing to the recipient; if used on an injured character, it can even kill him or her.

**Skill Check**: Upon completing this ritual, make a Survival skill check, using the tier of the disease as a penalty to this check as shown in the table below. The result indicates the amount of damage the character takes. Assuming the character survives, this damage can be healed normally.

| Disease Tier | Survival Check Penalty |
| ---- | ---------------------- |
| Adventurer | 0 |
| Champion | -5 |
| Epic | -10 |

| Survival Skill Check Result | Effect on Target |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0 or lower | Target dies |
| 1-9 | Target takes damage equal to the target's maximum hit points |
| 10-19 | Target takes damage equal to half the target's maximum hit points |
| 20 or higher | Target takes damage equal to one-quarter of the target's maximum hit points |
| 30 or higher | Target takes no damage |

If you know that your subject is suffering from multiple diseases, you must choose which one this ritual will cure. Otherwise, the ritual affects whichever single disease you knew about. You learn the disease tier when you begin the ritual, and at that point you can choose not to continue, without expending any components.

#### Delay Afflication

**Casting Time/Duration**: 30 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/10 gp

**Effect**: Delay Affliction puts a single enduring effect, any of those affected by Remove Affliction, on hold for a period determined by the ritual caster's check result. Until that time is up, the target acts in all ways as though he or she were not affected by the affliction. Upon completing this ritual, make a Survival skill check, using the level of the effect you are trying to delay (or the level of the creature that caused the effect) as a penalty to this check.
| Survival Skill Check Result | Duration |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 day |
| 10-14 | 3 days |
| 15-19 | 1 week |
| 20 or higher | 2 weeks |

#### Discern Lies

**Casting Time/Duration**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Market/Component Cost**: 10 minutes/5 minutes

**Effect**: You discern any untruths spoken in your presence during the duration. If anyone aided you while performing this ritual, they can't help you make the resulting Insight checks.

**Skill Check**: Make an Arcana skill check. Use the result as a bonus to your Insight checks to discern any lies or false truths.

#### Hand of Fate

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/10 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: When you perform the ritual, ask up to three questions about possible courses of action. A translucent blue hand appears and indicates with a gesture what the most rewarding course of action is.

If you describe courses of action that refer to directions or specific objects, then the hand points toward the choice that bears the greatest reward. If you ask the hand, “Should we head down the stairs or through the doors?” then the hand responds by pointing either to the stairs or the doors. If you ask the hand, “Which of these three levers should we pull first?” then the hand responds by pointing to a lever.

If you describe only a single course of action, the ritual assumes that inaction is your other option. The hand either beckons you (to indicate that you should proceed) or gestures for you to halt. For example, the question “Should we explore the ruins of Solitronia?” results in the hand either beckoning you or gesturing for you to halt.

The hand can't assess events in the far future; its judgment extends only to likely events in the next hour. If the hand can't indicate a preference, the ritual has no effect and expends no components.

There are two drawbacks to using the ritual to aid your decisions.

- Fate values rewards over risk, and this ritual provides guidance accordingly. It points you toward a high risk, high reward option before pointing you toward a low risk, low reward alternative. For example, if one tunnel leads to a dragon and great wealth and the other tunnel leads back to town, then the hand points toward the dragon. However, a high risk, low reward alternative is considered less rewarding than a low risk, low reward option.
- The hand can choose only the most rewarding course of action relative to the alternatives provided. That doesn't mean that the indicated choice is necessarily a good idea, only that it's a better idea than the other options you've indicated. In the example above, if all three levers activate traps, then the hand points toward the lever that triggers a trap less lethal than the others.

#### Iron Vigil

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/8 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You invoke your dedication to your god and let it wash your fatigue and needs from you. Iron Vigil fulfills your body's need for food and water when you perform it and allows you to remain aware and alert while taking an extended rest anytime during the ritual's duration.

#### Speak with Dead

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/10 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You ask the corpse of an intelligent creature questions and receive answers. The corpse knows what the creature knew in life, what has occurred near the corpse, and no more; the spirit has (usually) moved on to another plane and is not present in the body.

**Skill Check**: Your Religion check result determines the number of questions you can ask.
| Religion Check Result | Number of Questions |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| 9 or lower | 0 |
| 10-19 | 1 |
| 20-29 | 2 |
| 30 or higher | 3 |

#### Tongues

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/10 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp and a recovery

**Effect**: You or one ally present during the ritual's performance gains the ability to speak and understand all languages. Creatures that can hear the target understand what he or she says as if he or she were speaking their native language. If the target can hear another creature that is speaking a language, he or she understands what that creature says as if it were speaking the target's native language.

### Primal Rituals

#### Animal Friendship

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: When you perform this ritual, choose a nonhostile Tiny natural beast, such as a cat, a fox, a fish, a mouse, or a sparrow. This animal must remain nearby you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, the animal regards you as a friend and performs simple tasks on your behalf. The tasks are limited to the options below, and assigning a task requires a standard action.

_Fetch_: The animal retrieves a Tiny object of 10 pounds or less that you and it can see. If the animal is unable to carry the object due to the item's size or weight, the animal enlists the aid of other creatures of its kind to fulfill the task.

_Perform_: The animal performs a simple trick, such as rolling over or playing dead.

_Seek_: The animal scouts ahead and examines an area for anything that's alive or animate. The animal cannot travel far away from you and uses your passive Perception skill check to determine if it notices hidden creatures in the area. When the animal returns, you learn from it whether a creature occupies the area. The animal cannot communicate any other information aside from the presence or absence of a creature.

_Watch_: The animal remains in its current location and watches that area. When you assign the animal the task, you designate creatures that are allowed to enter the location. If a creature that you have not designated enters the location, the watching animal informs you by coming to you and making a noise. If you move far away from the area, the animal leaves its post and rejoins you.

Unless otherwise commanded, the animal accompanies you for the ritual's duration, perching on your shoulder, hiding in your pocket, or walking alongside you. The animal has AC 14, PD 12, and MD 12. The animal has 1 hit point, and a missed attack never damages the animal.

**Skill Check**: Your Nature skill check determines the length of time the animal remains in your service, but you can release an animal from your service as a quick action.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Duration |
| -------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 hour |
| 10-19 | 8 hours |
| 20 or 29 | 1 day |
| 30 or higher | 1 week |

#### Commune With Nature

**Casting Time/Duration**: 30 minutes/10 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: By communing with primal spirits of nature, you can learn a number of facts about your immediate environs (within 1 mile of you).

**Skill Check**: You can ask a number of questions, based on the result of your Nature skill check, about the terrain features, plants, minerals, bodies of water, creatures, and other aspects of your surroundings.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Number of Questions |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 |
| 10-19 | 2 |
| 20 or 29 | 3 |
| 30 or higher | 5 |

#### Feat of Strength

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/1 minute

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp

**Effect**: The Feat of Strength ritual confers to a single willing subject a significant boost of strength.

**Skill Check**: Your Endurance skill check has a bonus to the check determined by your Nature skill check result. The increase to Strength does not affect any other aspect of the character aside from making Endurance checks.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Bonus to Endurance Check |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 9 or lower | +1 |
| 10-19 | +2 |
| 20-29 | +5 |
| 30 or higher | +10 |

#### Shatter

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You can shatter all nonmagical objects composed of crystal, glass, ceramic, porcelain and similar fragile materials in a 2-square radius centered on you. An object heavier than 5 pounds, larger than Tiny, or more valuable than 25 gp is immune to this area effect.

You can instead focus the effect on one object of the proper composition. An object heavier than 50 pounds, larger than Medium, or more valuable than 250 gp is immune to this targeted effect.

_Ritual Scroll_: You can perform this ritual as a standard action when you do so from a scroll. If you do, the ritual affects a smaller area, and the GM makes a saving throw for each object in the area. On a save, the object is unaffected. If you use the targeted effect, the target gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw.

#### Speak with Nature

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/10 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: For the ritual's duration, you can communicate with natural beasts and mundane plants (but not plant creatures). The ritual does not make animals friendly, and the animals or plants are limited in their knowledge by their experiences and mobility. For example, a plant knows only about its immediate surroundings, and a fish can describe only what it has seen or experienced underwater.

**Skill Check**: Your Nature skill check result determines the number of questions you can ask.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Number of Questions |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 9 or lower | 0 |
| 10-19 | 1 |
| 20-29 | 2 |
| 30 or higher | 3 |

#### Starshine

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/8 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: When you complete the ritual, you create motes of blue light nearby you. Each mote hovers in a square of your choice and sheds dim light in a 2-square radius. The motes are intangible and cannot be interacted with. While within the radius of a mote's light, a creature takes a –5 penalty to Stealth checks.

**Skill Check**: Your Nature skill check determines the number of motes you create.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Number of Motes |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 |
| 10-19 | 2 |
| 20-29 | 6 |
| 30 or higher | 9 |

#### Traveler's Feast

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/24 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 150 gp/30 gp

**Effect**: You create food and water, enough to feed five Medium or Small creatures or two Large creatures for 24 hours. You designate the type of eaters when performing the ritual, and the ritual creates appropriate food (trail rations for people, grain for horses, and so on).

Any food or water created but uneaten disappears at the end of the duration.

#### Tree Stride

**Casting Time/Duration**: 30 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 250 gp/50 gp

**Effect**: You open a magical portal in a tree adjacent to you, connecting it to a second tree that you can see. You and up to eight allies can move through the portal and emerge instantly from the second tree, and return by stepping into the second tree.
**Skill Check**: The portal remains in place for a duration determined by your Nature skill check result, but only you and the designated allies can pass through the portal in either direction.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Duration |
| -------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 hour |
| 10-19 | 4 hours |
| 20-29 | 8 hours |
| 30 or higher | 24 hours |

## Level 3 Rituals

### Arcane Rituals

#### Analyze Portal

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: When you perform this ritual, choose a specific active and permanent portal you can clearly see. Analyze Portal causes the portal to erupt with faint lights that flicker and spin, letting you learn a great deal about its destination and function. Its most basic effect is to reveal the portal's destination. Although a portal usually displays what its destination looks like, this ritual reveals the destination's name and its general location in the world or the plane on which it is located.

When you learn the origin and type of the last creature to use the portal, you also learn any keywords associated with that creature.

Analyze Portal can also reveal the identity of the creature that created the portal. If no creature created it, you learn of the event that created it.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Additional Information |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 19 or lower | The name of the portal's destination |
| 20 or higher | The origin and type of the creature to use it last |
| 20 + the creator's level | Identity of the creature that created it, if any |

#### Aura Mask

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/24 hours (special)

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: When performed upon a magic item, Aura Mask makes it appear nonmagical when someone tries to use an Arcana skill check to detect magic. The ritual's effects last for 24 hours.

_Optional Focus_: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by leaving the item near a small, jeweled eye of gold and ruby wrapped in a silken blindfold. The blindfolded eye is a focus worth 100 gp. As long as the item remains nearby the focus, the Aura Mask remains in effect. You can hide or protect the ritual's focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within range. A single focus can maintain up to five Aura Masks or False Auras on five separate items, as long as they are all close enough to the focus.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check result determines the DC for the Arcana skill check to see through your deception. The Arcana skill check DC to determine that an item is magical is the higher of the item's normal DC or the result of your Arcana skill check made as part of this ritual.

#### Detect Treasure

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/5 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp, plus a focus worth 1000 gp

**Effect**: You hold out a gold rod while you focus your mind on finding nearby treasure. The rod pulls in your hands, pointing toward the most valuable concentration of wealth nearby.

When you finish performing the ritual, you can command the rod to detect only valuables within certain categories: metals, gems, other (art objects, maps, ritual components, and so on), or any combination of the above.

_Focus_: A gold rod you use in the performance of the ritual.

#### Glyph of Warding

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp and 2 recoveries

**Effect**: You inscribe a glyph that works as a dangerous trap on a flat surface such as a wall, chest lid, table, or door. As you create the trap, you set the glyph's damage type, trigger, password and/or exceptions. The trigger you set must require the trap's target to enter the glyph's square, pass within range of the glyph's attack, or open or handle a warded object without speaking the password or meeting an exception. Acceptable exceptions include creature origin, creature type, physical characteristics, and named individuals. The glyph becomes nearly invisible once it is completed. If the trap is triggered or disabled, the ritual is discharged.

#### Gravesight

**Casting Time/Duration**: 30 minutes/24 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: You are able to perceive the environment around an animate undead creature. The target creature must be nearby you during the entire time necessary to perform the ritual.

For the ritual's duration, you can spend an action to use the affected creature's senses. You use your Perception skill modifier when you do so. While sensing through the undead, you cannot use your own senses and are considered blind and deaf. You can end the effect as a free action. If the undead creature is destroyed, the ritual ends immediately.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines the maximum distance at which you can receive sensory input from the target creature.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Maximum Relative Distance |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 mile |
| 10-19 | 3 miles |
| 20-29 | 6 miles |
| 30 or higher | 10 miles |

#### Hallucinatory Terrain

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/24 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: You lay an illusion over a nearby area of natural terrain to make it look, sound, and smell as if it were a different type of natural terrain. Artificial structures, equipment, and creatures cannot be changed. A meadow might look like a hill, a pond could look like a meadow, and so on; but a road or a tower in the area remains the same.

A creature can discern the illusion if it succeeds on an Arcana skill check or a Perception skill check (DC 10 + your Arcana skill check modifier). This check is a quick action if the creature has not interacted with the illusion, but can be made as a free action the first time the creature interacts with the illusion. If you conceal an area of hindering terrain, a creature is still entitled to a saving throw if forced into that terrain.

#### Inquisitive Eyes

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: You cast your senses back through time to observe your current location as it was. You can observe the scene as if you were there, although you cannot affect anything.

**Skill Check**: You can observe a point in time ago no greater than a number of hours equal to your Arcana skill check result.

#### Leomund's Tiny Hut

**Casting Time/Duration**: 5 minutes/8 hours or until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: You create an opaque, unmoving sphere of magical force in the area nearby. Half the sphere is aboveground, while the other half is belowground. Creatures other than yourself can enter and exit the hut freely. If you exit the hut, the ritual is discharged.

The sphere's interior is 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and the exterior keeps out normal weather such as wind, rain, and dust. You can adjust the sphere's interior luminance from no light to dim light. The sphere is transparent from within but opaque (blocks line of sight) from the outside. Creatures inside the sphere have total concealment from creatures outside it.

#### Linked Portal

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: You create a shortcut across the fabric of the world, linking your location with a permanent teleportation circle somewhere else on the same plane. With a step, you can move from one circle to the other. As part of performing the ritual, you must sketch out a large circle in various rare chalks and inks. This temporary teleportation circle must exactly match the permanent teleportation circle at your destination. It disappears at the end of the portal's duration.

**Skill Check**: At the completion of this ritual, make an Arcana skill check. The result determines the duration that the portal remains open.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Portal Duration |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 round |
| 10-29 | 3 rounds |
| 30 or higher | 5 rounds |

You can use a permanent teleportation circle as the origin point of this ritual, making minor temporary modifications as part of the ritual. Doing this reduces the cost to 50 gp of reagents and grants you a +5 bonus to your Arcana skill check.

While the portal is open, any creature that enters the circle at the origin point instantly appears at the other location, along with anything the creature holds or carries. The creature can even finish the rest of its move. Any number of creatures of any size can use an open portal; the only limitation is the number that can reach the circle before it ends.

Anyone standing in the vicinity of either end of the portal can see a haze-infused vision of the teleportation circle at the other end of the connection, as well as the environment 60 feet beyond it. Effectively, everything at the destination within this area of visibility is lightly obscured, and the area beyond is completely fogged out. (Naturally, portals that last longer give you a better opportunity to study the place you're going to before you step into the circle.) Environmental effects at one end of the connection don't affect the other end.

Most major temples, important wizards' guilds, and large cities have permanent teleportation circles, each of which has a unique set of magic sigils etched or inlaid into the ground. The exact sequence of sigils matters, because you've got to match it if you want to open a portal leading there. The sigils aren't any more complex than remembering a string of letters and numbers. You can use Linked Portal to any permanent teleportation circle whose sequence of sigils you know. When you learn this ritual, your DM will tell you at least two such sequences. In your travels and research, you'll undoubtedly learn more.

This ritual can take you anywhere in the world, but it can't take you to other planes. Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block a teleportation ritual. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.

#### Protection From Energy

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/1 hour or until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp and a recovery

**Effect**: You protect yourself or one ally present during the ritual's performance with a potent ward against energy. The target, whether you or someone else, can provide the recovery component cost. Choose a damage type from among acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. The next time the target takes damage of that type, the ritual is discharged, and the damage is reduced by an amount equal to 10 + your Arcana skill check modifier.

If the target is already under this ritual's effect when the ritual is used upon the target again, the newer effect cancels the older one.

_Ritual Scroll_: You can perform this ritual as a standard action when you do so from a scroll. If you do, you reduce the damage the target takes by an amount equal to 5 + your Arcana skill check modifier.

#### Magic Map

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp, plus a focus worth 100 gp

**Effect**: When you perform this ritual, choose a specific creature. You must have an object that is tied to the creature, such as a bit of hair, a favorite scarf, or a personal weapon. You hold the object in one hand and suspend the focus from the other hand, holding it above a map representing a region no larger than 50 by 50 miles. If the creature is in the area, the focus is drawn to the creature's exact location as depicted on the map. As you watch, the focus follows the creature's movement.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines the duration of the time during which you can pinpoint the creature's location. This ritual is only as accurate as the map that is used.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 round |
| 10-19 | 10 rounds |
| 20-29 | 10 minutes |
| 30 or higher | 1 hour |

_Focus_: A crystal plumb bob worth at least 100 gp, and a body part or personal object of the creature.

#### Seal Portal

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: You sever the magical connections that bind one place to another by way of a portal. The completion of this ritual successfully shuts a currently active portal and seals it. No creature, object, or energy can pass through a sealed portal. The portal is not destroyed, though it becomes both invisible and intangible, meaning that it cannot be perceived or interacted with while sealed. If the portal would normally disappear after a certain amount of time, it does so.

**Skill Check**: At the completion of this ritual, make an Arcana skill check. A sealed portal can be reopened with the linked portal, planar portal, or true portal rituals, but the creature performing the ritual to reopen the portal must make an Arcana skill check that equals or exceeds the results of the Arcana skill check you made when performing this ritual. You can remove the seal on a portal you have sealed by performing this ritual on it again.

The magic of a sealed portal can be detected with the Arcana skill. The level of the magical phenomenon (the seal, not the portal itself) is equal to your level at the time you performed this ritual.

#### Shatter Bonds

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp and 2 recoveries

**Effect**: If your skill check succeeds against the DC to break, open, or escape the lock or restraint, that lock or restraint is opened. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you can choose to break the target instead of just opening it.

**Skill Check**: Make an Arcana skill check against each lock and restraint nearby.

#### Song of Sustenance

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/48 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp, plus a focus worth 1000 gp

**Effect**: Your performance nourishes up to ten Small or Medium creatures for the duration, as if they had enjoyed a great feast. The creatures also gain a +5 bonus to Endurance checks for the duration. You designate the affected creatures as part of performing the ritual, and they must hear all of it.

_Focus_: A musical instrument you play as part of performing the ritual.

#### Tune of Merriment

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/10 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp, plus a focus worth 1000 gp

**Effect**: For the ritual's duration, you and any ally who heard the whole performance of the ritual can roll twice and use either result when making Persuasion checks to influence anyone else who heard all of it.

_Focus_: A musical instrument you play as part of performing the ritual.

#### Water Breathing

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: When you perform this ritual, you can designate up to eight participants (including yourself if you wish) who breathe water as easily as they breathe air. Furthermore, they can speak normally underwater.

Water Breathing doesn't change your ability to breathe air. It doesn't confer a greater swim speed or the ability to fight underwater unhindered. It does protect any gear you and the participants carry, such as books and scrolls, from water damage.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check result determines the duration of the effect.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 2 hours |
| 10-19 | 4 hours |
| 20-29 | 8 hours |
| 30 or higher | 24 hours |

#### Wizard's Sight

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp, plus a focus worth 100 gp

**Effect**: When you perform a Wizard's Sight ritual, choose a location nearby you, you don't have to see or have line of effect to. You create a magical sensor in that location. You can see and hear as if you were standing there, and you have darkvision through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines how long the sensor lasts.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 round |
| 10-19 | 2 rounds |
| 20-29 | 3 rounds |
| 30 or higher | 5 rounds |

The ritual creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception skill check with a DC equal to 10 + 3 times your level to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way.

Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block Wizard's Sight. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.

_Focus_: A mirror or a crystal ball worth at least 200 gp. The focus conveys what you see and hear.

### Divine Rituals

#### Ghost Walk

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/8 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp, plus a focus worth 100 gp

**Effect**: You and up to 8 allies that participate in the ritual appear ghostly and can interact with the Ethereal Plane. Subjects gain a +5 bonus to Stealth checks, and the group treats its tracks as if they had been obscured. The ritual's effects end if any of its subjects dismisses it as an action, takes a rest, attacks, or is hit by an attack.

_Focus_: The graven heel bone of a deceased humanoid, set with jet and platinum.

#### Glyph of Warding

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp and 2 recoveries

**Effect**: You inscribe a glyph that works as a dangerous trap on a flat surface such as a wall, chest lid, table, or door. As you create the trap, you set the glyph's damage type, trigger, password and/or exceptions. The trigger you set must require the trap's target to enter the glyph's square, pass within range of the glyph's attack, or open or handle a warded object without speaking the password or meeting an exception. Acceptable exceptions include creature origin, creature type, physical characteristics, and named individuals. The glyph becomes nearly invisible once it is completed. If the trap is triggered or disabled, the ritual is discharged.

#### Protection From Energy

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/1 hour or until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp and a recovery

**Effect**: You protect yourself or one ally present during the ritual's performance with a potent ward against energy. The target, whether you or someone else, can provide the recovery component cost. Choose a damage type from among acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. The next time the target takes damage of that type, the ritual is discharged, and the damage is reduced by an amount equal to 10 + your Arcana skill check modifier.

If the target is already under this ritual's effect when the ritual is used upon the target again, the newer effect cancels the older one.

_Ritual Scroll_: You can perform this ritual as a standard action when you do so from a scroll. If you do, you reduce the damage the target takes by an amount equal to 5 + your Arcana skill check modifier.

#### Raise Dead

**Casting Time/Duration**: 8 hours/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: To perform the Raise Dead ritual, you must have a part of the corpse of a creature that died no more than 30 days ago. You apply mystic salves, then pray to the gods to restore the dead creature's life. The subject returns to life as if he or she had taken an extended rest. The subject is freed of any temporary conditions suffered at death, but permanent conditions remain.

The subject returns with a death penalty: –1 to all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. This death penalty fades after the subject reaches full recoveries.

You can't restore life to a creature that has been petrified or to a creature that died of old age.

The subject's soul must be free and willing to return to life. Some magical effects trap the soul and thus prevent Raise Dead from working, and the gods can intervene to prevent a soul from journeying back to the realm of the living. In all cases, death is less inclined to return paragon and epic heroes; the component cost is 1,000 gp for champion tier characters and 10,000 gp for epic tier characters.

#### Remove Affliction

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hours/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/160 gp

**Effect**: Remove Affliction wipes away a single enduring effect afflicting the subject. The ritual can remove curses, effects such as charm or domination, and fear, confusion, insanity, polymorph, and petrification effects. All effects of the curse or other effect end.

**Skill Check**: This ritual is physically taxing to the recipient; if used on an injured character, it can even kill him or her. Upon completing this ritual, make a Survival skill check, using the tier of the effect you are trying to remove (or the level of the creature that caused the effect) as a penalty to this check. The result indicates the amount of damage the character takes. Assuming the character survives, this damage can be healed normally.
| Effect Tier | Penalty |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Adventurer | 0 |
| Champion | –5 |
| Epic | –10 |

| Survival Skill Check Result | Effect on Target |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0 or lower | The target dies. |
| 1-9 | Damage equal to the target's maximum hit points. |
| 10-19 | Damage equal to half the target's maximum hit points. |
| 20-29 | Damage equal to one-quarter the target's maximum hit points. |
| 30 or higher | No damage. |

You can use this ritual on an unwilling subject (usually, a former ally who is under some enemy's influence), but you will have to restrain someone unwilling to undergo the ritual. If you know that your subject is suffering from multiple enduring effects, you must choose which one this ritual will remove. Otherwise, it affects whichever one affliction you knew about. You learn the affliction level when you begin the ritual, and you can choose not to continue, without expending any components (for example, if you determine the affliction is too powerful for you to remove).

### Primal Rituals

#### Stone Shape

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 minute/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp and 1 recovery

**Effect**: You form a large volume of stone, into whatever shape you wish. You could sculpt a statue, reshape a stone door, open a hole in a wall, and so on. You can manage only crude details, so you cannot create objects that have moving parts.

#### Water Breathing

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 400 gp/80 gp

**Effect**: When you perform this ritual, you can designate up to eight participants (including yourself if you wish) who breathe water as easily as they breathe air. Furthermore, they can speak normally underwater.

Water Breathing doesn't change your ability to breathe air. It doesn't confer a greater swim speed or the ability to fight underwater unhindered. It does protect any gear you and the participants carry, such as books and scrolls, from water damage.

**Skill Check**: Your Nature skill check result determines the duration of the effect.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 2 hours |
| 10-19 | 4 hours |
| 20-29 | 8 hours |
| 30 or higher | 24 hours |

## Level 4 Rituals

### Arcane Rituals

#### Arcane Barrier

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/4 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You create a magical barrier large enough to block a doorway or the entrance of a hallway. The obstruction is invisible to anything that is far away but is readily apparent as a translucent, shimmering, paper-thin wall from closer than that.

**Skill Check**: When creating the barrier, you also determine circumstances that open the barrier; this is the same as for [Arcane Lock](#arcane-lock). Your Arcana skill check, with a +5 bonus, determines the DC for Knock or similar rituals to open it, and the DC to burst the barrier with an Athletics skill check is 5 greater than that.

If you spend 4 hours and four times the component costs to perform this ritual, the duration increases to permanent. A ritual caster who uses Knock or a similar ritual to open a permanent Arcane Barrier can choose to bring it down temporarily, in which case it seals again after 5 minutes, or to destroy the barrier.

#### Aria of Revelation

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp, plus a focus worth 400 gp

**Effect**: When you finish performing the ritual, each ally who heard it can make an Arcana, a History, a Mechanics, or a Nature skill check to uncover a clue or recall a bit of useful information. The ally must have points in the skill.

**Skill Check**: Your allies gain a bonus to the skill checks based on your Arcana skill check result.

#### Banish Illusions

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hours/24 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You weave a ward against illusions nearby. Any invisible creature within the area or that enters the area becomes visible. In addition, illusion powers take a -2 penalty to attack rolls, and creatures in the warded area gain a +5 bonus to Insight skill checks against illusions.

#### Chameleon's Cloak

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/24 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You conceal yourself and up to 8 allies within 5 squares of you, using a combination of camouflage and distraction to ensure that no one notices any of you. A concealed creature that leaves the square it occupies at the completion of the ritual or that attacks a creature loses all benefit from the ritual.

**Skill Check**: The Perception DC to notice a creature concealed by this ritual is equal to the Arcana or Nature skill check result with a +5 bonus.

#### Chorus of Truth

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/30 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp, plus a focus worth 400 gp

**Effect**: Creatures nearby you while you perform the ritual take a penalty to Persuasion checks determined by your skill check result. The penalty lasts for the duration of the ritual.

**Skill Check**: The penalty to Persuasion checks is equal to your Arcana skill check result.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Persuasion Penalty |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 9 or lower | –2 |
| 10-19 | –4 |
| 20-29 | –6 |
| 30 or higher | –10 |

#### Conceal Object

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: One object within 5 squares of you becomes difficult to notice, no matter how obvious it is.

**Skill Check**: Any creature with line of sight to the object is entitled to a Perception skill check at a DC equal to your Arcana skill check result with a +5 bonus. A creature that touches the object gains a +5 bonus to the check, and a creature that is rudely forced to notice the object (such as by walking into a wall it was unable to notice) automatically sees the concealed object. Moving the concealed object ends the effect.

#### Detect Object

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/5 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: Name an object. For the duration of the ritual's effect, you can detect the direction and distance to the nearest example of that object, as long as one is within the range defined by your Arcana skill check result. When attempting to locate a specific object you gain a penalty based on how well you know the object.
| Object Familiarity | Penalty |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| Very familiar to you | 0 |
| Seen once by you | -5 |
| Described by you | -10 |

**Skill Check**: The range of the ritual is equal to your Arcana skill check result.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Range |
| ------------------------- | ----- |
| 9 or lower | Nearby |
| 10-19 | Far Away |
| 20-29 | 1 mile |
| 30 or higher | This plane |

#### Demicache

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You create a small, personal demiplane that can store nonliving items of up to 250 pounds. The demiplane has a portal that is 6 inches in diameter and is always open. The portal floats near you or can be affixed to your clothing (like a pocket), and you can retrieve items from the portal as a minor action. The portal is visible to others, and it moves with you at your speed.

**Skill Check**: At the completion of the ritual, make an Arcana skill check. The result determines how long the portal stays open. If the portal closes before you retrieve the stowed objects, they appear at your feet.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 day |
| 10-19 | 1 week |
| 20-29 | 1 month |
| 30 or higher | 1 year |

#### Drawmij's Instant Summons

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: Use this ritual to attune one weapon, implement, or shield to yourself. At any time in the future, you can summon that object to your hands as a quick action, at which time the ritual is discharged. Through this ritual, you can have only one weapon, implement, or shield attuned to you at a time.

#### Elemental Transference

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: Use this ritual in the world. When you perform this ritual, you transport yourself and up to eight allies to a random spot in the Elemental Chaos. You have no control over where you appear, but your immediate environs aren't hazardous. Once in the Elemental Chaos, you can travel as normal within the plane. You remain in the Elemental Chaos until you leave by another means.

#### Hallucinatory Creature

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/24 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You create the illusion of a single creature, of any size from Small to Large. It looks and smells like the creature in question. If the creature can speak or emit sounds, the illusion can do so as well, but on a limited basis (subject to the DM's judgment)—it's not possible, for instance, for the illusion to engage in an extended conversation.

**Skill Check**: You can give the illusion simple instructions, such as having it wander a set area, appear to chew on local plants, and the like. Your Arcana skill check determines the number of actions you can instruct the illusion to take.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Actions |
| ------------------------- | ------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 quick; 1 move|
| 10-19 | 1 standard; 1 quick; 1 move |
| 20-29 | 1 standard; 2 quick; 2 move |
| 30 or higher | 2 standard; 2 quick; 2 move |

#### Passwall

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/1 minute

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You create a passage through any solid material. You choose the orientation of the passage relative to the surface you touch. The passage is medium in size. The passage can be as deep as you want. This ritual does not conceal the passage from anyone or bar anyone from entering. A creature inside the passage when it closes takes 5d10 damage and is ejected to the nearest end of the passage. This ritual does not affect the structural integrity of a cavern or a wall; the passage is a twist in space, not an actual shifting of material.

#### Reverse Portal

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You create a shortcut across the fabric of the world, linking your location with a [permanent teleportation circle](#linked-portal) elsewhere on the same plane. As part of performing this ritual, you sketch out a 10-foot-diameter circle in rare chalks and inks. Alternatively, you can use a permanent teleportation circle, which reduces the component cost to 150 gp and grants you a +5 bonus to your Arcana skill check.

**Skill Check**: At the ritual's completion, make an Arcana skill check. The result determines the duration that the portal remains open.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Portal Duration |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 round |
| 10-19 | 3 rounds |
| 20-29 | 5 rounds |
| 30 or higher | 10 rounds |

The portal displays views of the other location in the same way as that created by the Linked Portal ritual, but creatures cannot enter the origin point and appear at the other location. Instead, creatures can only step into the distant end of the portal to appear at the origin point with you.

#### Rope Trick

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/7 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp, plus a focus worth 500 gp

**Effect**: When you perform Rope Trick, the ritual's focus passes through a portal and into a temporary demiplane. The portal entrance occupies a medium location you choose. A creature can climb down the rope into a demiplane that is about the size of a large room.

The entrance to the demiplane appears as a subtle shimmer and has solid transparency. A successful Perception skill check (DC 15 + your level) allows a creature outside the portal to detect the entrance. The portal can be locked with the [Arcane Lock ritual](#arcane-lock), and unless you choose to lock the portal, the demiplane remains accessible from the outside.

Once the ritual ends, the demiplane disappears, and any creatures or objects in the demiplane appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the demiplane's former entrance. The ritual's focus appears where the demiplane's entrance was. The ritual caster can choose to end the ritual at any time.

_Focus_: A silver rope worth at least 2,000 gp.

#### Seeming

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/4 hours (special)

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: Upon completing the ritual, you and up to eight allies assume the appearance of any Medium humanoid creatures. The ritual allows you to assume the general appearance of a particular race, but not of a unique creature. The ritual's effect is centered on you; if any ally moves far away from you, the ritual's effect ends for that ally.

**Skill Check**: Creatures viewing or interacting with you or your allies can make an Insight skill check to detect the deception. The check's DC equals your Arcana skill check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees you and each time it interacts with you or one of your allies. If the creature touches you or an ally, it automatically realizes the deception.

#### Song of Restfulness

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp, plus a focus worth 1000 gp

**Effect**: When you perform this ritual at the beginning of an extended rest, you reduce the time needed for the extended rest by 2 hours for yourself and any allies who hear the performance. A character can benefit from this ritual only once during any 24-hour period.

_Focus_: A musical instrument you play as part of performing the ritual.

#### Shadow Walk

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/8 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You and your allies walk through shadows stretching out of the Shadowfell, taking advantage of the strange disparities between distance in your realm and that one to travel quickly. Multiply your overland travel speed by 5 for the duration. This ritual functions only in the Prime Material plane.

#### Solace Bole

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/1 hour

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You and up to five other creatures you designate nearby you are transported to a sealed hollow the size of a comfortable room within a magical tree in the Feywild. The hollow has a glowing light you can control and is filled with sweet air. You can remain within the bole for up to 12 hours. Thereafter, or when you will it to be so, you and all the creatures the ritual took to the hollow return to the exact place they left. Only 1 hour of time has passed in the world. If you took an extended rest within the bole, you must wait 12 hours after your return to the world to take another one.

If you have assistance when performing this ritual, divide the casting time by the number of participants. The assistants all chant in a fey harmony while you perform the ritual. Anyone you want to assist you in this way can learn the proper harmony during an extended rest.

#### Tenser's Binding

**Casting Time/Duration**: 5 minutes/12 hours (special)

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: This ritual affects a target creature, which must be helpless and nearby the ritual caster for the time spent performing the ritual. At the ritual's completion, the target is bound by arcane chains.

**Skill Check**: Escape from these bonds is at a DC equal to the Arcana skill check result plus 5, and the ritual's magic prevents the target from teleporting unless the prisoner's level is higher than that of the ritual caster.

Before the ritual expires, it can be renewed by any creature able to perform rituals, not just the original ritual caster. As long as the ritual is not allowed to end, it retains the strength imparted by the original caster.

### Divine Rituals

#### Consult the Sages

**Casting Time/Duration**: 30 minutes/10 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You ask a single question of mysterious, extraplanar presences about matters beyond your ken. Make an Arcana skill check with a +10 bonus instead of an Arcana or a History skill check to uncover a clue, remember a bit of lore, or otherwise gain information about the world around you.

The ritual grants you a single piece of information. That information can take the form of a word, a name, a phrase, or even a brief story, depending on what exactly you're looking for. You can learn the name of the usurper who ended the Katerran Dynasty a thousand years ago, the burial rites of the Crimson Wolf clan, or the weaknesses of the shadow assassins who have been dogging your steps.

The ritual can't uncover information beyond the ken of the most learned sages. It's of no use if you're trying to find the magic word that unlocks the vampire's crypt, because only the vampire knows the word. Nor can the ritual tell you definitively where great stores of treasure are, but the sages could tell you where a specific empress kept her treasury in ancient times or whether the treasure was looted when her empire fell.

#### Dream Concordance

**Casting Time/Duration**: 5 minutes/One Extended Rest

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,200 gp/250 gp

**Effect**: When you take an extended rest, you perform this ritual on yourself and up to six unconscious subjects. The subjects' conscious minds are transported to a subdimension within the Ethereal Plane, where their bodies manifest as if they were conscious. The ritual can be used for three primary purposes: private conference, information retrieval, or battling a mind-affecting predator. Some use this ritual to combat madness.

The subdimension created by the ritual is a virtual world built from the dreams of one or more of the ritual's subjects. At the start of the ritual, each participant names a specific creature or location. These elements typically populate the dreamscape, though the precise nature of the subdimension as an adventure environment is at the DM's discretion. In the dreamscape, the participants' actions and conversations cannot be observed with scrying rituals. Here the participants can search for knowledge locked in a subject's mind, perhaps a forgotten memory or a closely guarded secret. Creatures that lurk in dreams, such as succubi, might be discovered in the dreamscape, and slaying such a creature there banishes it from the mind of its victim. The means by which information is discovered and creatures are encountered is up to the DM.

Living creatures at 0 hit points or fewer when the ritual is performed manifest in the dreamscape with 1 hit point; all other living creatures maintain their current game statistics. All resources spent in the dream are expended in reality as well, except for powers granted by consumables or magic items. Damage taken in the dreamscape is converted to psychic damage and then applied to the sleeping subject, and hit points regained in the dreamscape are likewise regained in reality. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points or fewer while in the dreamscape is instantly ejected from it, but remains unconscious and stable with 0 hit points.

When the ritual ends, all subjects awaken, but they do not gain the benefits of a rest for the purposes of a full recovery.

#### Reordination

**Casting Time/Duration**: 4 hours/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp plus 4 recoveries

**Effect**: This ritual aligns someone already invested with divine power with the deity or faith for which the ritual was created. It could be a deity that a person strayed from and wishes to return to, or it might be a different faith altogether. It cannot be performed by the character who is being reordained, but that character can assist. In most cases, the candidate for reordination is expected to complete a quest to prove his or her commitment to the new faith before the ritual is used.

Upon completion of the ritual, its subject becomes associated with the appropriate deity, allowing him or her to select feats, talents, spells, or any other class options requiring that tie. That person's previous association is dissolved, along with access to any related feats, powers, or other class options.

If the ritual's subject is converting to a new deity, a feat or talent associated with his or her former deity can be immediately exchanged for an appropriate one.

In addition, once the ritual is complete, the reordained character becomes vaguely aware of the existence and number of any agents (for example, angels or clerics) who have been charged with destroying him or her for crimes of heresy or apostasy. This awareness sharpens when such beings come within 1 mile of the character, but it does not identify or locate them. The awareness lasts for 7 days.

### Primal Rituals

#### Land Ward

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/24 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp plus 2 recoveries

**Effect**: You ward the land in a massive area.

**Skill Check**: Creatures that attempt to use a power associated with defiling (one that has defile, defiling, or defiler in the name) within the warded area must succeed on an Arcana skill check against a DC equal to the result of the Nature skill check you make when performing this ritual. A creature that fails this check spends the action necessary to use the power but does not expend the power.

At the end of the ward's duration, you can spend a recovery to extend the ward for an additional 24 hours, even if you are not near the ward's area. If the ritual's effect is sustained in this way without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.

#### Trailblaze

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/8 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: Natural wilderness moves aside so that you can pass, creating a clear path ahead and behind you. As you travel, you ignore natural obstacles that would slow your overland speed. The natural terrain returns to normal once you pass, and the Perception skill check DC to track your party increases by 5 as though you had obscured your tracks.

#### Water's Gift

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 600 gp/120 gp

**Effect**: You and up to seven other creatures present for the ritual take on certain aquatic abilities: the ability to breathe water as easily as air, to speak underwater normally, and to fight underwater without penalty. Each subject also gains a +5 power bonus to Athletics skill checks to swim.

**Skill Check**: Your Nature skill check result determines the duration of the effect.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| 14 or lower | 3 hours |
| 15-24 | 6 hours |
| 25 or higher | 12 hours |

## Level 5 Rituals

### Arcane Rituals

#### Eye of Warning

**Casting Time/Duration**: 30 minutes/24 hours (special)

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,000 gp/200 gp

**Effect**: This ritual works the same as [Eye of Alarm](#eye-of-alarm).

In addition, an eye of warning automatically detects any scrying sensor that appears or moves within 10 squares of it, treating the sensor as an intruder. Furthermore, the eye destroys the sensor immediately after warning you unless the creator of the scrying sensor succeeds on an Arcana skill check (DC 20 + your level). Wherever you are, you instantly know if the eye encounters a sensor. Each round the sensor remains nearby an eye, the eye attempts to destroy it again.

_Optional Focus_: As with the Eye of Alarm ritual, you can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual focus is a small, jeweled eye made of gold and ruby, worth 1,600 gp.

#### Planar Sending

**Casting Time/Duration**: 20 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,000 gp/200 gp

**Effect**: You convey a mental message of up to 25 words to a person you know on another plane. You must choose a plane when you complete the ritual. If the target is not on that plane, they do not receive the message.

#### Ravage Time

**Casting Time/Duration**: 30 minutes/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,000 gp/200 gp

**Effect**: Ravage time magically accelerates the effects of time on an object, causing it to weaken, decay, and crumble into dust. This ritual affects only nonmagical inanimate objects such as gear, armor, weapons, food, and corpses.

**Skill Check**: A single performance destroys a 5-foot cube of materials of a type based on the Arcana skill check result.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Material Type |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |
| 14 or lower | Unpreserved organic materials |
| 15-24 | Preserved organic materials |
| 25-34 | Metals |
| 35 or higher | Minerals |

- Unpreserved Organic Materials: This category includes any foodstuffs, liquids, uncured leather, plant materials, carcasses, and so on. A successful ritual results in transforming this substance into foul-smelling slime.
- Preserved Organic Materials: These items include cured leather, specially preserved foodstuffs, wooden weapons, and specially treated plant or animal based objects. An item affected dissolves into a disgusting paste.
- Metals: This category includes iron doors and bars, weapons, metal jewelry, cutlery, and metallic finished items. Such objects rust or corrode, becoming brittle or turning to dust.
- Minerals: Minerals include gemstones such as rubies, diamonds, and similar precious stones, as well as all metal ore. Ravage time reduces these items to dust.

#### Ritual of Retrieval

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 2,000 gp/200 gp

**Effect**: You perform this ritual at a specific safe location, attuning the site so that your body returns to it if you are killed. On the first round after you die, your body and all your possessions burn away to ash, reforming (still dead) in the locale you attune with this ritual. If the attuned location has been destroyed or altered in a way that prevents your body's return, the ritual fails.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines how long your retrieval site remains attuned.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| 14 or lower | 1 week |
| 15-24 | 1 month |
| 25-34 | 1 year |
| 35 or higher | Permanent |

#### Telepathic Bond

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,000 gp/200 gp

**Effect**: For the duration of the ritual, you and up to eight allies can communicate telepathically. You do not need to share a common language to communicate telepathically.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check result determines the duration of the ritual.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 30 minutes |
| 10-19 | 1 hour |
| 20-29 | 3 hour |
| 30-39 | 8 hours |

### Divine Rituals

#### Astral Sojourn

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,000 gp/200 gp

**Effect**: You must use this ritual in the world. When you perform this ritual, you transport yourself and up to eight allies to a random spot in the Astral Sea.

Creatures that travel the Astral Sea using this ritual have a faint silver nimbus surrounding them, which coalesces into a ghostly cord trailing a few inches from the neck. The manifestation of the cord represents the traveler's connection to the location from which they departed the world.

If you or one of your affected allies leaves the Astral Sea, such as by stepping through a portal to another plane, then the ritual ends and all participants return to the location from which they departed the world. At the end of the ritual's duration, or upon the death of the ritual caster, the participants also return to the location from which they departed the world.

The ritual caster can choose to end the ritual at any time. This requires 10 minutes, has no cost or skill check, and instantly returns all participants to the world. A participant always returns to the same location from which he or she departed the world.

**Skill Check**: At the completion of the ritual, make an Arcana skill check. The result determines how long the ritual's participants remain in the Astral Sea.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| 14 or lower | 3 days |
| 15-24 | 1 week |
| 25-34 | 3 weeks |
| 35 or higher | 1 year |

### Primal Rituals

#### Control Weather

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,000 gp/200 gp

**Effect**: You change the weather outside in a 2-mile radius centered on you. The change is limited by the current season. Choose from the options below based on the season.
| Season | Weather Results |
| ------ | --------------- |
| Spring | Heat wave, sleet storm, or thunderstorm. |
| Summer | Hailstorm, heat wave, or rainstorm. |
| Autumn | Cold snap, fog, sleet, or windstorm. |
| Winter | Blizzard, windstorm, or thaw. |

You control the weather's general tendencies, such as the direction and intensity of the wind or the degree of obscurity from fog, hail, rain, and snow. You cannot control specific applications of the weather, such as where lightning strikes.

**Skill Check**: You can alter the weather among the available options as an action for the duration of the ritual, which is determined by your Nature skill check. Each time you choose to change the weather result, the new weather conditions take 10 minutes to manifest.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| 9 or lower | 4 hours |
| 10-19 | 8 hours |
| 20-29 | 16 hours |
| 30 or higher | 24 hours |

#### Primal Prison

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Permanent (special)

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,000 gp/200 gp

**Effect**: You imprison a nearby creature in a tree, a boulder, or another solid natural object. The subject must be helpless or willing, and the object you imprison it inside must be larger than it.

**Skill Check**: Your Nature skill check determines the maximum level of the subject.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Maximum Level |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |
| 14 or lower | Your level -2 |
| 15-24 | Your level |
| 25 or higher | Your level +2 |

The subject remains imprisoned until you choose to discharge the ritual or until you die. In addition, you must take a personal effect from the subject and hide it or carry it with you. If the personal effect is brought to the subject's location, the subject can be released.

You choose whether the subject ages while imprisoned, and the subject is unaware of its surroundings. Destroying the imprisoning object releases the subject, who appears in the object's space, bloodied and asleep, if the creature is capable of sleep. You know if the object is destroyed, regardless of your distance from it.

The imprisoning object you takes on a faint resemblance to the subject. Knots in the shape of the subject's face might form on a tree, or a stone might take on coloration faintly depicting the subject's silhouette.

#### Revitalize

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,000 gp/200 gp

**Effect**: You transform an area of defiled terrain into normal terrain.

**Skill Check**: The size of the area you transform is determined by the result of your Nature skill check.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Area Transformed |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 14 or lower | Medium Area |
| 15-24 | Large Area |
| 25-34 | Huge Area |
| 35 or higher | Massive Area |

## Level 6 Rituals

### Arcane Rituals

#### Anthem of Unity

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/1 day

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,000 gp/200 gp, plus a focus worth 3,000 gp

**Effect**: When you perform the Anthem of Unity for a crowd of ordinary people—peasants, commoners, artisans, and the like—you unite them behind a single cause. Only creatures whose tier is lower than yours can be affected by this ritual.

The crowd must not be hostile to you and must be able to see and hear you for the entire performance. At the end of the ritual, you can request a single service from the crowd, to which the members of the audience respond as if you were a trusted friend. You can request anything that doesn't involve violence, put the listeners at inordinate risk or imperil their friends or family, or place them in financial ruin. For example, you might ask the listeners to help put out a fire raging in the city, hide you and your allies from searching guards, or provide you with shelter or food.

**Skill Check**: A Persuasion check made at the end of this ritual determines what sort of help you can request.
| Persuasion Skill Check Result | Effect |
| ----------------------------- | ------ |
| 9 or lower | The listeners perform an action that lasts up to 1 hour and that benefits them in at least some small way. |
| 10-19 | The listeners perform a task that lasts up to 1 hour and that poses no risk or reward to them. |
| 20-29 | The listeners perform a task that lasts up to 6 hours and that poses a mild risk but at least some benefit to them. |
| 30 or higher | The listeners perform a task that lasts up to 1 day and that poses a mild risk without any benefit to them. |

The number of individuals affected extends to anyone who witnesses the entire performance, so the larger the venue, the more people you can affect.

_Focus_: A musical instrument you play as part of performing the ritual.

#### Create Teleportation Circle

**Casting Time/Duration**: 4 hours/24 hours (special)

**Market/Component Cost**: 3,000 gp/600 gp plus 5 recoveries

**Effect**: You create a teleportation circle with a unique sequence of magic sigils, which you and other ritual casters can useas a location marker for rituals such as [Linked Portal](#linked-portal) and [Planar Portal](#planar-portal). The teleportation circle does not transport creatures anywhere on its own—it merely enables other travel rituals.

The teleportation circle lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster can extend the duration by spending a recovery every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to see or even be on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the teleportation circle becomes permanent.

#### False Aura

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/24 hours (special)

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,500 gp/300 gp

**Effect**: False Aura makes a nonmagical item seem to be a magic item, making it appear magical to an Arcana skill check to detect magic.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check result determines the DC for someone else's Arcana skill check to detect magic to see through your deception. If the detect magic check fails, the inspecting character believes the item to be magical. You choose the fake power source of the item when performing the ritual. However, anyone attempting to use the item immediately recognizes its magic as fake.

The ritual's effects last for 24 hours.

_Optional Focus_: You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by leaving the item near a small, jeweled eye of gold and ruby wrapped in a silken blindfold. The blindfolded eye is a focus worth 100 gp. As long as the item remains nearby the focus, the False Aura remains in effect. You can hide or protect the ritual's focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within range. A single focus can maintain up to five [Aura Masks](#aura-mask) or False Auras on five separate items, as long as they are all close enough to the focus.

#### Far Sending

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,500 gp/300 gp

**Effect**: Far Sending functions like [Sending](#sending), except you do not make an Arcana skill check to determine its range. Far Sending can deliver messages anywhere, regardless of distance or location.

#### Stasis Shell

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Until moved

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,500 gp/300 gp

**Effect**: You perform this ritual on an object in your possession, encasing it in a thin layer of crystal. Until a creature moves the object more than 5 squares in a single round, that layer of unbreakable crystal protects the affected object from all damage and from all effects of age. It is as if time has stopped for the object.

### Divine Rituals

#### Adjure

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/8 hours or until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,500 gp/300 gp

**Effect**: You command an immortal creature whose level does not exceed yours. The subject of this ritual must be able to see and hear you and must remain nearby you for the entire time necessary to perform the ritual. Because most creatures do not willingly submit to this ritual, you must usually make the creature helpless or restrain the creature by means of a Magic Circle ritual. Unless it is prevented from doing so, the creature can leave at any time. Finally, you must be able to communicate with the creature, or the ritual automatically fails.

To determine the extent of your authority over the subject, you engage in a special skill challenge during the time it takes to perform the ritual. The DCs for the checks in this challenge are equal to twice the subject's level + 10. Arcana is the primary skill; each time you or an ally succeeds on a Arcana skill check in the challenge, you or an ally can use Persuasion, History, Arcana, or Intimidate for one subsequent skill check. Once you have amassed 3 failures or achieved 10 successes, the skill challenge ends. Consult the following table and apply the effect associated with the number of successes you achieved.
| Number of Successes | Effect |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| 0 or 1 | The creature has authority over you and can issue one command that you must obey, a task that requires up to a day of effort. |
| 2 or 3 | You have immediate authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform one task that takes no more than 5 minutes. |
| 4 or 5 | You have moderate authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a day of effort. |
| 6 or 7 | You have significant authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a week of effort. |
| 8 or 9 | You have great authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a month of effort. |
| 10 | You have ultimate authority over the creature. You can command the creature to perform a task that requires up to a year and a day of effort. |

When the specified task is completed, the ritual is discharged, and the creature (or you) is released from service. You can request any kind of service that does not compel the subject to obey multiple commands, force the subject to engage in combat, or ensure the subject's death. (The subject can engage in combat to achieve a task if it wishes, but combat cannot be required.) If the task is impossible, such as commanding a creature that cannot fly to soar into the sky, the creature can ignore the command.

#### Consult Oracle

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/10 minutes

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,500 gp/300 gp

**Effect**: You coax forth an Oracle Eternal. Oracles have no tangible presence and no agendas; they exist only to observe events. This makes them unparalleled sources of information because they have the potential to have seen and heard everything, even information otherwise known to only one creature.

**Skill Check**: Make a Religion check to determine how many questions you can ask an oracle before it vanishes.
| Religion Skill Check Result | Number of Questions |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 9 or lower | 1 |
| 10-19 | 2 |
| 20-29 | 3 |
| 30 or higher | 5 |

Each question is answered immediately, so you know the answer to one question before asking the next. You must phrase your question so that the oracle can answer it with a single word or a brief phrase. For the oracle to know the answer to a question, the answer must be known to at least one creature, even if that creature is no longer alive. The oracle has no foreknowledge and only a limited ability to judge what it sees. The oracle can tell you the order in which to activate the glyphs in front of the Gate of the Black Drake, but it can't answer the question “Will we do well if we venture through the gate?”

Ten minutes after you finish performing the ritual, the oracle leaves, even if you have unasked questions remaining.

#### Fantastic Recuperation

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 1,500 gp/300 gp

**Effect**: You absorb the fatigue that you and your allies have suffered and cast it away. At the end of the ritual, you and your allies gain the benefits of an extended rest without spending any time resting. You cannot use this ritual if you could not normally begin an extended rest.

Greater heroes accrue greater fatigue and require more effort to recuperate. At 8th level, this ritual costs 4,500 gp to perform. At 10th level, this ritual costs 22,500 gp to perform.

## Level 7 Rituals

### Arcane Rituals

#### Forbiddance

**Casting Time/Duration**: 30 minutes/24 hours (special)

**Market/Component Cost**: 2,500 gp/500 gp, plus 5 recoveries

**Effect**: No scrying sensor can enter the area of Forbiddance and no creature can teleport into it, unless the sensor or the creature is a higher tier than the ritual caster who performed the ritual.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines the size of the warded area.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Warded Area |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| 14 or lower | Nearby |
| 15-19 | Far away |
| 20-29 | Very Distant |
| 30 or higher | Anywhere on this plane |

The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster (not any assistants) can extend this duration by expending a recovery every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.

#### Memory Seal

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 2,500 gp/500 gp

**Effect**: You lock a single memory away so that the targeted creature can no longer recall it. A single memory sealed away by this ritual can be specific (“seeing me stealing the Darlingian Scepter” or “how to enter my secret laboratory”) or general (“what you read in my journal” or “the last conversation you had today”).

A target of this ritual must be either willing or helpless for the duration of the ritual. You can target yourself with this ritual only if you have at least one assistant in performing it.

**Skill Check**: On an unwilling target, your Arcana skill check result must beat the target's MD defense for the ritual to succeed, in addition to determining how hard the ritual is on the target (in terms of damage; see below).
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Effect on Target |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| 19 or lower | Damage equal to the target's maximum hit points |
| 20-24 | Damage equal to three-quarters the target's maximum hit points |
| 25-29 | Damage equal to half the target's maximum hit points |
| 30-34 | Damage equal to one-quarter the target's maximum hit points |
| 35 or higher | No damage |

#### Planar Portal

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 2,500 gp/500 gp

**Effect**: This ritual works the same as Linked Portal, except that you can use it to travel to other planes. As with [Linked Portal](#linked-portal), your planar destination must have a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you have memorized.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines how long the portal remains open.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Portal Duration |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| 14 or lower | 1 round |
| 15-24 | 3 rounds |
| 25 or higher | 5 rounds |

When you first learn this ritual, you learn the sigil sequences of two common planar locations, as determined by the GM.

#### Plane Shift

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 2,500 gp/500 gp, plus a navigation focus

**Effect**: You move any number of creatures and objects or even a vehicle (including the vehicle's pilot, crew, and load) from one plane to another.

At the ritual's conclusion, you name a location you have previously visited. The location must be a fixed place, and it must be in the same location it was when you last visited it.

**Skill Check**: Once the location is named, make an Arcana skill check. The check determines the distance between you and your destination when you arrive on the plane.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Distance from Destination Location |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 9 or lower | An adjacent or random plane determined by the GM |
| 10-19 | 100 miles |
| 20-29 | 10 miles |
| 30-39 | Nearby |

_Focus_: A tuning fork made of a specific metal and tuned to the frequency of the object plane.

### Divine Rituals

#### Succor

**Casting Time/Duration**: 8 hours/Permanent until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 2,500 gp/500 gp, plus 4 recoveries and a focus worth 800 gp

**Effect**: You must perform this ritual inside a shrine, a temple, or some other site of religious significance to your deity. Succor attunes the ritual's focus to the site, linking the two until the ritual is discharged. After the time required to perform the ritual, the creature holding the focus can spend an action to activate the ritual's effect: At the end of the creature's next turn, the creature and up to eight willing creatures within its line of sight teleport to the holy site to which the focus was attuned, and the ritual is discharged. Succor crosses any distance and planar boundaries.

Any effect or condition that prevents teleportation also prevents this ritual from functioning (but does not discharge it).

_Focus_: Prayer beads, a holy book, or some other item of religious significance.

### Primal Rituals

#### Wind Walk

**Casting Time/Duration**: 30 minutes/10 hours

**Market/Component Cost**: 2,500 gp/500 gp

**Effect**: You and all allies within 5 squares of you become weightless and gain the overland flight ability. You lose your quick, interrupt, and regular actions while flying, and can use your move action only to fly. If you take actions to do anything else, you crash. When using this ritual to fly for 10 hours, including rests, you can travel approximately 100 miles.

## Level 8 Rituals

### Divine Rituals

#### Divine Sight

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 4,000 gp/800 gp

**Effect**: You grant yourself the ability to discern deities and the servants of deities (such as exarchs and angels) who walk among mortals, limning those you see in a holy glow that is visible only to you. When you see such a creature, you also learn to what deity the creature serves. Objects, places, and creatures that are favored or cursed by the gods are likewise delineated, and this ritual allows you to intuit the relative importance of the object, place, or creature to its deity.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines how long the effect lasts.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| 14 or lower | 3 hours |
| 15-24 | 8 hours |
| 25 or higher | 1 day |

## Level 9 Rituals

### Arcane Rituals

#### Scrying

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 6,000 gp/1,200 gp, plus a focus worth 10,000 gp

**Effect**: When you perform this ritual, choose a specific creature. You create a magical sensor nearby that creature, and you can see and hear as if you were standing where your sensor is located. You need not personally know or have ever seen the subject. However, when performing the ritual you must describe your intended subject with sufficient clarity that the ritual unambiguously knows which creature you're talking about. This ritual can show you a creature anywhere in the world, but it can't show you a creature on another plane.

The magic of the ritual interprets your statement of intended subject in the most straightforward way possible. If your description is insufficient to determine a specific creature, the ritual fails and no components are expended. If your statement describes a subject other than the one you intended, the ritual still functions and the components are expended.

You have no inherent way to discern where the sensor is in relation to you, but careful observation might give you some clues. The sensor moves with the subject for the duration of the effect.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines how long the sensor lasts.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Duration |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| 14 or lower | 1 round |
| 15-24 | 2 rounds |
| 25-34 | 3 rounds |
| 35 or higher | 5 rounds |

You can hear through the sensor as well as see, and you have darkvision through it. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.

Observe Creature creates a scrying sensor—a shimmer in the air—that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception skill check with a DC equal to 15 + your level to notice the sensor. If the target of this ritual notices your scrying sensor, the target can use an action to focus its will in an attempt to destroy the sensor. Make an opposed Insight skill check; if the target's result is higher than yours, the sensor is destroyed and you spend one recovery but regain no hit points. The subject can repeat this effort until the sensor is destroyed or the duration ends.

Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the [Forbiddance](#forbiddance) ritual, can block Observe Creature. If the subject's location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.

_Focus_: A mirror or a crystal ball worth at least 10,000 gp. The focus conveys what you see and hear.

#### Ward the True Name

**Casting Time/Duration**: 8 hours/Permanent until discharged

**Market/Component Cost**: 6,000 gp/1,200 gp

**Effect**: If anyone anywhere in the world performs a divination or scrying ritual that is intended to gather information about you—such as someone using [Consult the Sages](#consult-the-sages) or [Consult Oracle](#consult-oracle) to ask questions about you, or using [Scrying](#scrying) to spy on you—you instantly become aware of it. You do not learn the nature of the ritual caster's questions or efforts. You learn only the specific ritual that was performed. You also gain the ability to identify the ritual caster well enough to scry upon him or her in turn.

The effect of this ritual ends when you have been alerted to a divination or scrying attempt.

### Divine Rituals

#### Voice of Fate

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Instantaneous

**Market/Component Cost**: 6,000 gp/1,200 gp, plus 5 recoveries

**Effect**: You consult an entity of fate—perhaps a servant of Avandra, Ioun, Pelor, or the Raven Queen—for a glimpse into what the future holds. You ask questions, and a rumbling voice replies.

**Skill Check**: Your Arcana skill check determines the number of questions you can ask.
| Arcana Skill Check Result | Number of Questions |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 19 or lower | 3 |
| 20-24 | 4 |
| 25-29 | 5 |
| 30-34 | 6 |
| 35 or higher | 7 |

Your questions must relate to a specific goal, event, or activity that has yet to occur. Since what is yet to occur is not known by any mortal being, the answers need not be known by any creature, alive or dead. This ritual can answer only questions related to events occurring within the next 7 days. After that, the skein of possibilities is too indistinct to gain useful information.

The guidance from the entity of fate is accurate, but great heroes are capable of thwarting fate, at least for a time. If the ritual reveals that a course of action is “certain doom,” you should realize that nothing is truly certain until it happens. In addition, the entity of fate assumes that you will act on its guidance completely and immediately. If you don't act on the information, or if you change the conditions in existence when you performed the ritual, then the guidance might no longer be useful.

### Primal Rituals

#### Shift Mote

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/1 day

**Market/Component Cost**: 7,500 gp/1,800 gp and 5 recoveries

**Effect**: You seize control of an earthmote and influence its motions. It lurches forward and proceeds slowly across the sky, moving at 1 mile per hour in a direction you choose. You must be on the earthmote to perform the ritual and to direct it. If you leave while the ritual is still in effect, the mote slows to a stop within an hour, traveling one-half mile in that time.

You can also elect to change the mote's altitude up to 1 mile over the course of the duration.

Those who know this ritual keep it carefully guarded, for the ritual has devastating potential.

## Level 10 Rituals

### Arcane Rituals

#### Lich Transformation

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 10,000 gp/2,000 gp, plus a focus worth 10,000 gp

**Effect**: At the conclusion of this ritual, you die, transform into a lich.

An integral part of becoming a lich is creating a phylactery, a magical receptacle containing your life force. When you are reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you and your possessions crumble to dust. Unless your phylactery is located and destroyed, your reappear in a space nearby to the phylactery after 1d10 days.

_Focus_: You must construct your phylactery before the ritual can be performed. The phylactery, which takes 10 days to create, usually takes the form of a small trinket or piece of jewelry on which magical phrases have been transcribed in your blood. Your Phylactery is nearly indestructible.

If your phylactery is destroyed, you can build a new one; the process takes 10 days and costs 5,000 gp.

#### True Portal

**Casting Time/Duration**: 10 minutes/Special

**Market/Component Cost**: 10,000 gp/2,000 gp

**Effect**: This ritual works the same as [Linked Portal](#linked-portal), except as noted here.

You are not limited to teleporting to places you've seen or that have permanent teleportation circles. However, when performing the ritual, you must describe your intended destination clearly. “Lord Ambrose's audience chamber” is sufficient, as is “the nearest temple of Pelor.” Your description must use only place names and other static references; you can't say “wherever Princess Katria is” or “the nearest pile of gold.” The magic of the ritual interprets your intended destination in the most straightforward way possible. If your description is insufficient to determine a specific destination, the ritual fails, but no components are expended. If your description causes the portal to lead somewhere you did not intend—for example, if the nearest temple of Pelor is not in the city you'd hoped it would be—the ritual still functions, and the ritual's components are expended.

If the destination is blocked by a warding ritual, such as Forbiddance, the ritual opens the destination portal at a point along the ward's boundary. You can see through the portal before you enter, and you don't have to step through if you don't want to.

You can use a teleportation circle as the origin point of this ritual, making minor temporary modifications as part of the ritual. Using a teleportation circle reduces the ritual's component cost to 1,000 gp and grants a +5 bonus to your Arcana skill check.

### Divine Ritual

#### Imprisonment

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 20,000 gp/4,000 gp

**Effect**: You imprison a creature within a demiplane created by this ritual. The creature to be imprisoned must be either helpless or willing, and it must be present for the entire performance of the ritual. When the ritual is complete, an invisible magical field envelops the creature, putting it into suspended animation, and the creature falls into a space beyond the normal bounds of the cosmos. Only divination rituals performed by creatures of your level or higher can determine the location of the imprisoned creature.

You must set one or more possible conditions that release the creature, should they come to pass. You can set an imprisoned creature free by performing a ritual of release that has no component cost and takes 1 hour. A freed creature has no memory of the events that occurred during its imprisonment, and it appears in the world on the ground closest to where it was imprisoned.

### Primal Ritual

#### Raise Land

**Casting Time/Duration**: 1 hour/Permanent

**Market/Component Cost**: 10,000 gp/2,000 gp

**Effect**: Successfully performing the Raise Land ritual enables you to lift a specific quantity of ground into the air. The depth of the earth affected extends down to half the area's radius, thus a 20-square-radius section of land is 10 squares thick. The freed earth rises at a rate of 10 feet per round until it attains a height equal to the radius (or less, if you choose). If this ritual is attempted indoors, the raised land stops once it hits a barrier.

**Skill Check**: Your Nature skill check determines the radius of the area affected.
| Nature Skill Check Result | Radius of Area Affected |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 14 or lower | Nearby |
| 15-19 | Far Away |
| 20-24 | 1 mile |
| 25-29 | 10 miles |
| 30 or higher | 10 miles or Sight |
