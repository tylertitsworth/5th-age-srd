# Relationships

A relationship can be a person, organization, and/or deific figure that have their own story, alignment, and personality. The general knowledge and history about them may vary in depth and accuracy; they may be well-known or mysterious. They have their own relationships with other figures, too, which may be friendly, tolerable, or acrimonious.

## Relationship Points

Your character has relationship points. For each relationship your character has, the points value determine whether or not the relationship is positive, conflicted (at 0 points), or negative.

A Relationship can have up to 5 points, and for each positive point gained there is a tangible, scaling benefit that your character receives. Negative accumulated points can impact positive and conflicted relationships that you and other characters have and potentially raise the stakes of the game.

## Advantages

Advantages are the benefits your character receives in a positive relationship. Each time a character gains a new positive relationship a relevant skill check is made to determine the advantages the character receives from this relationship.

Players work with their GM to determine how advantages scale with more positive relationship points. Relationship points are gained through roleplay and story, as well as advancing to champion and epic tier.
