# Strongholds

Strongholds are an optional objective for the heroes to pursue. They are a place where the heroes can rest, recover, and prepare for the next adventure. They are also a place where the heroes can recruit new allies, and where they can train and improve their skills.

## Requirements

Heroes must be at least champion tier and acquire some workforce to build the stronghold. When choosing a Stronghold to build, the class associated with that stronghold must currently be in the party and the workforce must agree to build that stronghold as relevant.

## Cost Table

If the heroes find destroyed or abandoned stronghold, they can repair it for half the usual cost and time it would normally take, so long as that stronghold is the same type as the original.

| Stronghold | Associated Class | Cost (GP)\* | Time (Days)\* |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Camp | Barbarian | 1000 | 30 |
| Chapel | Paladin | 6000 | 180 |
| Establishment | Rogue | 3000 | 90 |
| Fane | Occultist | 4000 | 120 |
| Fortress | Commander | 7500 | 225 |
| Graveyard | Necromancer | 3000 | 90 |
| Grove | Druid | 2000 | 60 |
| Keep | Fighter | 5000 | 150 |
| Library | Wizard | 3000 | 90 |
| Lodge | Ranger | 3000 | 90 |
| Monastery | Monk | 4000 | 120 |
| Sanctum | Psion | 5000 | 150 |
| Tavern | Any | 2000 | 60 |
| Temple | Cleric | 4000 | 120 |
| Theater | Bard | 4000 | 120 |
| Tower | Sorcerer | 5000 | 150 |

>\*Heroes are allowed to pay more money to decrease the amount of time it takes to build the stronghold, the amount of time reduced is determined by the GM.

## Castles

If multiple characters chip in to pay for a stronghold—or one character just spends a lot of money—it is a castle and provides multiple benefits. Complex tasks take proportionally more time and money than simple ones, so a castle costs 10% more and takes 10% longer for every basic stronghold function it incorporates. A castle cannot contain multiple of the same type of stronghold.

## Stronghold Upgrades

You can spend more money to build a larger stronghold from the start, but there is no time or cost savings.

| Level | Size | Toughness | Cost (GP) | Time (Days) |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 1st | d6 | 22 | - | - |
| 2nd | d8 | 24 | 2,500\* | 50\* |
| 3rd | d10 | 26 | 5,000 | 100 |
| 4th | d12 | 28 | 7,500 | 150 |
| 5th | d20 | 30 | 10,000 | 200 |

>\*Strongholds that take less time to build may have their cost and time reduced based on the original original cost and time ratio above.

## Stronghold Benefits

### Camp

---

#### Demesne Effects

- Ale within the barbarian’s demesne is particularly refreshing, bringing good cheer with no hangovers the next day no matter how much is consumed.
- Wildlife within the barbarian’s demesne grows especially large and fierce, migrating as the camp moves.
- Poisons brought into the barbarian’s demesne neutralize within the hour. No such cowardly “civilized” forms of death are permitted.

---

#### Chieftain's Rage

Whenever the Barbarian reduces an enemy to 0 hit points, they can make an additional attack or move up to their speed. You can do this a number of times equal to your camp level. You regain all expended uses after a full recovery.

---

#### Followers

Barbarians prefer followers who are independent and don’t require a lot of oversight. They don’t classically attract a large retinue, and they don’t usually build great keeps to house their staff and servants. A barbarian’s follower must be at home in wild places, willing and able to relocate quickly and live by their wits.

---

### Chapel

#### Demesne Effects

- Clear blue skies and warm sun dominate year-round. Rain falls only at night, and thunderstorms avoid the area.
- Evil creatures in daylight have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.
- The paladin is instantly aware of the presence and location in his demesne of any chaotic or evil creature with more than 7 Hit Dice. The range of this awareness is a number of hexes equal to the level of the paladin’s stronghold.

---

#### Righteous Smite

The Paladin's Smite Evil burns through enemy resistance. Enemies automatically fail resust checks to holy damage. Enemies immune to holy are now only resistant to it, and make a resist 11+ check. You can do this a number of times equal to your chapel level. You regain all expended uses after a full recovery.

### Establishment

#### Demesne Effects

- One ally per level of the rogue’s stronghold can hide in the rogue’s demesne, and no mundane or magical means will reveal their location. This ability does not work on the owner of the stronghold.
- Creatures trespassing in the rogue’s demesne have the overwhelming sensation they are being spied upon.
- When a creature hostile to the rogue and aware of their existence finishes a long rest within the rogue’s demesne, roll a d20. On a roll of 10 or less, the creature triggers a hidden trap, taking 3d8 piercing damage.

---

#### Vengeful Momentum

When the Rogue is hit with an attack and would lose momentum, they can choose not to lose momentum as a result of that attack. You can do this a number of times equal to your establishment level. You regain all expended uses after a full recovery.

### Grove

#### Demesne Effects

- Local birds and mammals in the druid’s demesne can speak Common and Elven. They enjoy talking to new people but will try to find and warn the druid if suspicious strangers enter the demesne.
- Nuts, fruits, and vegetables grown naturally (i.e., not farmed or cultivated) in the druid’s demesne grant those who eat them the effect of goodberry. If taken outside the demesne, they lose this effect.
- No roads or trails in the druid’s demesne last more than a day. However, allies and the units of allies can pass through the demesne as though there were roads.

---

#### Goodberry

While resting the Druid and their allies can each eat a Goodberry, they gain 1 recovery and the benefits of a days sustenance. You can do this a number of times equal to your grove level. You regain all expended uses after a full recovery.

---

#### Followers

Living between civilization and wilderness, the druid attracts followers willing to put up with a life devoted to the health and well-being of nature, defending it and learning its secrets. Few are willing to walk this path, but those who do are totally devoted to the druid’s service.

Druids care little for the command and upkeep of large armies, preferring to use battle magic to raise special units when necessary. This being said, they are one of the classes that can attract flying units, often hawkriders or units mounted on giant owls.

Few artisans are interested in a life lived outside civilization, but druids are spellcasters and loremasters so it’s natural for alchemists, sages, and scribes to pledge service in exchange for greater knowledge.

Ambassadors who wish to join a druid’s retinue are usually fey, or aligned with them, or creatures who prefer the swamps and bogs that druids are naturally attracted to as sources of power. Also, druids have their own short list of special allies they may recruit from among the fey creatures of the wood.

### Lodge

#### Demesne Effects

- Stags, harts, and other game are always plentiful in the ranger’s demesne, but they are larger and fiercer than normal.
- Enemies of the ranger and the locals must make DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) skill checks to navigate the ranger’s demesne. On a failure, they are attacked by 2d6 winter wolves.
- Allies treat the ranger’s demesne as favored terrain when moving their units. Enemy units treat it as difficult terrain.

---

### Sanctum

#### Demesne Effects

- Spells cast in the psion's demense have a 15% chance to result in a high weirdness effect.
- Folks who live in the psion’s demesne for a season begin to exhibit a random psionic affinity. They lose the affinity if they ever leave.
- The material properties of objects in the psion's demense will randomly lose fundamental properties. For example, gravitation loss, fusing, state change, or density change.

---

#### Weird Control

When the Psion would roll of the High Weirdness table, they can instead choose which High Weirdness effect to apply. You can do this a number of times equal to your sanctum level. You regain all expended uses after a full recovery.

---

#### Followers

A Psion attracts no followers, they are alone in their quest to master the mind. While a sanctum is present in a larger castle all follower rolls have a -10 per sanctum level, and if a follower roll result is below 1 they do not receive any followers.

---

### Tavern

When any party member is rolling for advantages in the tavern related to an increase in a positive relationship, roll twice and take the higher result.

---

#### Revenue

Each season (or every three months, depending on the calendar of your campaign world), your establishment generates 1,000 gp per establishment level.

If your establishment is part of a larger castle, you can use this money to upgrade your castle, no problem.

---

#### Rumors

During an adventure or in the lead-up to one, you can spend some money and collect some rumors about the quest you’re about to go on. The cost is 100 gp per establishment level. On a successful skill check, you learn:

- The name of one kind of creature you’ll be fighting (goblins, bandits, dragons, oozes, etc.)
- Roughly how many there will be (a few, a dozen, dozens, a score, scores, etc.).

During the adventure, those creatures will be vulnerable to damage from your attacks, for a number of attacks equal to your establishment level.

In addition, the GM can choose to reveal any of the following:

- The location of a secret door or a hidden entrance or exit • The location and nature of a trap
- A description of one riddle or puzzle
- The location and description of one powerful magic item It may seem like this is taking the fun out of the adventure, but for the player with the establishment it will seem like the opposite. It will make them feel awesome, and at the end of the day, you can always add more traps and secret doors!

### Temple

#### Demesne Effects

- Folks who live in the cleric’s demesne are immune to disease.
- The cleric can hear the prayers of those living in their demesne who are in concordance with the cleric’s deity.
- While the cleric is hale, the weather in their demesne is fair. If the cleric is wounded or suffering, the weather turns foul. For this effect to happen, the cleric merely has to be on the same plane as their demesne.

---

#### Manifest Divinity

When the Cleric casts Heal, they can choose all allies next to\* them rather than just one. You can do this a number of times equal to your temple level. You regain all expended uses after a long rest.

>\* If they take the adventurer feat, they can choose all allies nearby to them.

### Theater

#### Demesne Effects

- Whenever the wind blows through the trees in the bard’s demesne, music plays. Hooves on roads beat out a complex rhythm.
- Folks who live for a week in the bard’s demesne find themselves ending conversations with rhyming couplets.
- Thunder can be counted on to roll whenever someone in the bard’s demesne says something dramatic. Ravens obediently alight on nearby branches when it is dramatically expected of them.

---

#### Enduring Inspiration

While the Bard is channelling a Bardic Song, they can choose to continue the song and automatically succeed on the sustain check. You can do this a number of times equal to your theater level. You regain all expended uses after a full recovery.

Average folks find wizards weird enough, gabbling in strange languages and living up to their eyeballs in books and owl poop. But they, at least, have rules. A sorcerer, on the other hand, gains their power through an innate connection with the forces of magic. No training required. This is even less well understood by normal people. A sorcerer’s followers therefore tend to be folks who enjoy being close to raw power and do not fear what they do not understand.

A sorcerer’s army is usually light and highly mobile. Unlike other classes they eschew large, slow, heavily armed and armored soldiers and they can attract flying units. Their retainers are almost all spellcasters. Their artisans are folks who enjoy making things and probably hope that being in the court of a sorcerer will grant them the opportunity to create magic items. Their ambassadors come from cultures that do not fear sorcery and whose soldiers would have no problem serving under a commander who can conjure fire through sheer will.
