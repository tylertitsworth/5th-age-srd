# Feats

Characters choose a feat at 1st level, and at every subsequent level.

Feats appear in three tiers: Adventurer Tier Feats, Champion Tier Feats, and Epic Tier Feats. Adventurer Tier Feats are available to any character between level 1 and level 10. Champion Tier:s are available starting at level 5. Epic Tier Feats are available starting at level 8.

## Feats per Level

| **Level** | **Adv. #** | **Cham. #** | **Epic #** |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 1 | | |
| 2 | 2 | | |
| 3 | 3 | | |
| 4 | 4 | | |
| 5 | 4 | 1 |
| 6 | 4 | 2 |
| 7 | 4 | 3 |
| 8 | 4 | 3 | 1 |
| 9 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| 10 | 4 | 3 | 3 |

Since humans start with an additional feat at 1st level, add one to the number of adventurer tier feat's humans possess all the way up the chart.

Most of the feats in the game are attached to specific class talents, attacks, and spells. If a feat is attached to a talent, power, or spell, you must have the talent, power, or spell in order to choose the feat. When there is more than one feat attached to a specific talent or power, you have to choose the lower tier feats before you pick up the higher tier feats.

## General Feats

These are general feats available to any character. A character can't take a specific feat more than once. A few general feats only have adventurer-tier versions; others also have champion- and epic-tier versions that can be added later in your career.

### Linguist

#### Adventurer Tier

This feat allows you to speak enough of the standard humanoid languages to comprehend enough of what most other humanoids are saying or screaming during battle. You are not fluent in all these languages, no one will mistake you for a native speaker, and your vocabulary is adventurer-centric (heavy on words connected to danger rather than philosophy or emotions).

You can also read enough to get by in all these languages.

#### Champion Tier
